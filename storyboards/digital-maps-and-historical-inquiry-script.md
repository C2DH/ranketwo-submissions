# Digital Maps & Historical Inquiry — Open, Modular Script Template (3–5 min)

**Goal**
Introduce non-specialists (history students & instructors) to critical ways of reading and using digital maps, while keeping maximum flexibility for adding your own visuals/examples.

**Tone**
Warm, invitational, curious. Avoid jargon; when needed, gloss terms in lower-thirds.

**Runtime**
3:00–5:00 (choose modules; each beat ≈ 25–40s). Add/remove beats as needed.

---

## Beat 0 — Title Card (5–10s)

**VO prompts (choose one or write your own):**

* “Maps aren’t just pictures of places; they’re arguments about the past.”
* “What can a digital map help us see—and what might it hide?”

**On-screen**
Minimal title: *Digital Maps & Historical Inquiry*. Optional subtitle: *A short introduction for non-specialists*.

**Graphic ideas (pick any):**

* Phone-map UI morphs into paper atlas texture
* Animated compass/lens icon revealing layers

**Transition options:** quick cross-wipe using a circular mask • zoom into first layer

---

## Beat 1 — Maps Are Made, Not Found (25–40s)

**VO prompts:**

* “Every map reflects choices—what to include, what to simplify, and how to symbolize it.”
* “Projection, scale, color, categories, labels: each choice nudges interpretation.”

**On-screen prompts:**

* Sticker list: Projection • Scale • Categories • Color • Audience
* Add a small ‘info’ tag: “Treat maps like sources, not mirrors.”

**Graphic menu:**

* Quick flip between two projections (e.g., Mercator vs. equal-area)
* Choropleth with two classification schemes (quantiles vs. natural breaks)

**Lower-third (gloss):** *Source criticism for maps*

---

## Beat 2 — Three Questions for Any Map (25–40s)

**VO prompts:**

* “Start with three questions: Who made it and when? Which design choices do the work? For whom was it made, and why?”

**On-screen prompts:**

* Tabs: **Provenance** • **Design** • **Intent**
* Use short bullets under each tab (3–4 words each).

**Graphic menu:**

* Metadata card: Creator • Date • Repository • Rights
* Sliders for color/classification • Labels appearing/disappearing

**Optional insert (+10s):** Same dataset, two palettes → two impressions

---

## Beat 3 — Repositories Mediate Access (25–40s)

**VO prompts:**

* “Digital archives expand access—but also mediate what we see through scan quality, metadata, licenses, and downloads.”
* “Good metadata speeds research; poor metadata slows or skews it.”

**On-screen prompts:**

* Repository cards with toggles: Zoom • Download • Metadata • License

**Graphic menu (concrete examples):**

* **OldMapsOnline**, **David Rumsey**, **Virtuelles Kartenforum**, **Arcanum** — show four mini-cards with creator, purpose, scope, display type (static vs. interactive), reuse/licensing. (You can stage a quick comparison of two: Kartenforum vs. Arcanum.)

**Callout:** *Check before use: creator • purpose • scope • rights*

**Exercise tie-in (on-screen microcopy):** “Compare 3 repositories; note provenance fields, display mode, reuse terms.”

---

## Beat 4 — Maps as Data (GIS Layers) (25–40s)

**VO prompts:**

* “Maps can be data. In GIS, we layer roads, rivers, events, and statistics on a georeferenced base to analyze change.”
* “Switching layers on/off can reveal patterns that text alone hides.”

**On-screen prompts:**

* Layer stack: Basemap → Rail lines → Hospitals → Events → Census
* Timeline scrubber highlighting a short period (e.g., 1914–1919)

**Graphic menu (concrete examples):**

* **WWII Luxembourg ‘Spatio-Temporal Map’**: show 4 layer thumbnails; animate toggling layers and changing underlying basemap to demonstrate different appearances.
* **Geopackage anatomy**: three boxes labelled Spatial data • Attribute data • Metadata ➜ “Layers in QGIS.”
* **Dataset example**: “Administrative Boundaries of the Russian Empire (1820s)” (Imperiia Project) — quick callout: source, documentation, transliteration fields.

**Lower-third:** *Layered information (GIS)*

**Optional insert (+10–20s):** Same overlay, different basemap → perceptual shift.

---

## Beat 5 — Map vs. Aerial/Photo (Corroboration) (25–40s)

**VO prompts:**

* “Different media show different truths. Compare a topographic sheet to an aerial image to test accuracy and context.”

**On-screen prompts (concrete case):**

* Split screen: **Topographic map of Stettin/Szczecin (1945)** vs. **RAF aerial photograph (28 Nov 1943)**.
* Pulse shared landmarks: converging rail lines • Oder/Odra river bend • river island; annotate items visible only in the photo (goods wagon depot, hospital complex, bomb damage) vs. not on the topo sheet.

**Graphic menu:**

* Swipe reveal: map → photo → map; magnifier tool to align features.
* Tiny metadata chips: “Creator/date/place” noting anachronisms (e.g., “Poland” label in 1943 metadata).

**Callout:** *Corroborate across media; inspect metadata for anachronisms*

---

## Beat 6 — Counter‑Cartography & Power (25–40s)

**VO prompts:**

* “Maps can challenge power, not just reflect it. Who counts? Who belongs? Where are the edges?”
* “Reading against the grain is part of doing history.”

**On-screen prompts (concrete references):**

* Clip cue: *This Is Not an Atlas* (first 6 minutes) as a visual nod.
* Screenshot motif from **Remapping Zurich** (archived) as an example of participatory/lived-experience mapping.

**Graphic menu:**

* Palette flips from official atlas style to community map with annotations; speech bubbles with short quotes.

**Lower-third:** *Counter‑cartography*

**Optional activity nudge:** “Draw two ‘commute’ maps under different conditions; discuss how context changes design.”

---

## Beat 7 — Hand‑off to Exercises (20–30s)

**VO prompts:**

# Voiceover Script (≈5:00)

*(Paced at ~140–145 wpm. Read warmly, with curious, invitational tone.)*

**[0:00–0:15] Opening**
What if the maps we use every day weren’t just directions, but historical arguments?
In the next few minutes, we’ll explore how digital maps can sharpen our questions—and how a critical eye helps us avoid easy answers.

**[0:16–0:55] Maps are made, not found**
Every map is a set of choices: what to include, what to simplify, and how to symbolize it.
Projection, scale, color, categories, labels—each one nudges interpretation.
That’s why historians treat maps like sources, not mirrors. We ask: who made this map, when, and for whom? What do its design choices emphasize or hide? And, ultimately, what story is the map trying to tell?

**[0:56–1:35] Three questions for any map**
Start with three simple questions.
First, provenance: who created the map, on what date, and where does the digital copy come from?
Second, design: which symbols, color scales, borders, or categories are doing the argumentative work?
Third, intent and audience: was the map meant for administrators, the general public, policymakers, or classroom use?
Keeping these three in mind turns a beautiful image into a readable document.

**[1:36–2:15] Repositories mediate access**
Digital archives make historical maps easier to find, but each platform mediates what you see.
Scan quality varies. Metadata can be rich—or frustratingly sparse. Licenses may invite reuse or restrict it.
As you browse collections—whether a broad aggregator or a focused library—pause to check creator, purpose, scope, and rights.
Good metadata speeds research and lets you trace a map’s origins. Poor metadata slows you down or, worse, misleads.

**[2:16–3:00] Maps as data—thinking in layers**
Maps aren’t only pictures; they can be data. In GIS, we place information on a georeferenced base and work in layers—roads, rivers, events, statistics—so we can analyze change over time and space.
Turning layers on and off can surface patterns that text alone might hide. The same overlay can feel different on different basemaps, so design still matters.
Think of GIS as a way to ask questions: What clusters? What aligns? What changes when we shift the period, the boundary, or the classification?

**[3:01–3:40] Comparing media—map and aerial photograph**
Different media show different truths. A topographic sheet generalizes features to keep the map legible at scale. An aerial photograph captures what stood—or didn’t—on a particular day.
Place them side by side, align a few landmarks, and read across. Which features match? Which details appear in one but not the other?
Always glance at the metadata. Dates, creators, and place names can reveal anachronisms or political conventions that shaped how information was recorded.

**[3:41–4:20] Counter‑cartography and power**
Maps don’t just reflect power; they can challenge it. From imperial atlases to activist counter‑maps, cartography tells stories about who counts, who belongs, and where the edges are.
Reading against the grain means asking: whose perspective is centered here? Which communities are missing? What alternative boundaries or categories would change the picture?
Sometimes the act of mapping—collecting lived experience, annotating, re‑naming—is itself the historical argument.

**[4:21–4:55] Your turn—practice with the exercises**
Now it’s your turn. In the exercises, you’ll compare map repositories, evaluate metadata, and reflect on licenses. You’ll analyze design choices and intent. You’ll experiment with projections, contrast a map with an aerial image, and explore layered data in a simple GIS view.
Use the provided checklists, then adapt them to your topic. Add the questions that matter for your case study.
By the end, you won’t just use digital maps—you’ll read them critically and make defensible, historically informed choices.

**[4:56–5:00] Close**
Maps don’t just show the past—they shape how we think about it. Let’s begin.
