## Introduction

Source code represents one of the most important forms of born-digital heritage today. Why preserve and study historical code? This lesson will help you answer these questions, and demonstrates how the intellectual, cultural, and social contexts of code's creation matter, making it a valuable historical resource for understanding our digital age. This lesson introduces you to applying traditional source criticism methods to digital materials, teaching you to view code as both a technical and cultural artifact. At its most basic level, source code consists of human-readable computer instructions, but as we will explore, it is much more than mere technical documentation. The methodological approach through this lesson focuses on three key skills: contextual analysis, critical evaluation, and comparative assessment—rather than technical programming skills. While designed for beginners in digital source criticism, some exercises will require basic digital navigation skills and familiarity with academic research practices.

In this lesson, we will guide you through three key dimensions of understanding code as heritage:

1. **Heritage Recognition:** We will first examine what qualities make source code a distinctive type of born-digital heritage. This includes understanding how UNESCO recognizes it and exploring the unique preservation challenges it presents.
2. **Interpretive Methods:** Next, we will develop strategies for reading and interpreting code that go beyond its technical functionality. We will approach code as a cultural artifact that reveals important insights about its creators' assumptions, values, and practices. Through detailed case studies, we will explore how the traditional tools of source criticism must be adapted for born-digital materials, connecting our analysis to broader questions in digital history and critical code studies.
3. **Preservation Initiatives:** Finally, we will examine how source code is being preserved through major international initiatives, with special focus on Software Heritage. We will also explore complementary approaches like the GitHub Archive Program and the Internet Archive's Software Collection, understanding how different preservation strategies address different aspects of code as heritage.

Each section includes practical exercises designed to develop your critical thinking about digital sources rather than technical programming skills. By the end of this lesson, you will understand how to approach source code as a historian, recognizing its possibilities as historical evidence.

## 1 Understanding Digital Heritage Recognition

> [!NOTE]  
> **Learning Objectives for Section 1:**
> By completing this section, you will be able to:
> - Define source code and explain its dual nature as technical artifact and cultural expression
> - Trace how source code gained official recognition as digital heritage
> - Identify the main threats to code preservation (technological obsolescence, platform changes, storage ephemerality)
> - Evaluate why active preservation strategies are necessary for digital materials

### 1.a Defining Source Code: Between Technical Function and Cultural Expression - 25 min

To define our object of study, let's consider Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman's insightful 1996 observation that remains highly relevant in today's programming best practices: "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." What does this mean? Source code can be defined as the fundamental set of instructions of a program; human-readable computer commands written in higher-level programming languages that require compilation or interpretation to become executable ([Krysa & Sedek 2008: 237](https://monoskop.org/images/a/a1/Fuller_Matthew_ed_Software_Studies_A_Lexicon.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A515%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22Fit%22%7D%5D)).

![The famous "Hello, World!" program written in C by Brian Kernighan on dot-matrix computer paper, from The C Programming Language (1978)](/assets/images/code-as-heritage/Hello_World_Brian_Kernighan_1978.jpg "Hello World program by Brian Kernighan")

**Figure 2:** The iconic "Hello, World!" program written in C by Brian Kernighan in 1978, featured in the seminal book *The C Programming Language*. This simple two-line program represents the foundational example that introduces new programmers to their first language and embodies both the technical nature of source code and its role in programming education and culture. The program is preserved on acid-free dot-matrix computer paper as part of historical collections. *Credit: Brian Kernighan, [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), via [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hello_World_Brian_Kernighan_1978.jpg)* 

This definition helps us understand an essential tension in computing: while source code is ultimately designed to be executed on a machine, it is also fundamentally a form of human communication that bears witness to its historical context and contains valuable traces of the past.

Computer scientist Darrell Ronald Raymond emphasizes this in his 1991 article Reading source code: "the main role of source code is not a compilable entity, but a human-readable statement of intent and mechanism in the program" ([1991:3](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/962111.962113)). This also implies that code is more than written words. It is both an object and an action, simultaneously enabling and constraining activities ([Méadel and Sire 2017](https://shs.cairn.info/revue-reseaux-2017-6-page-9?lang=fr&tab=texte-integral)).

The socio-technical nature of source code creates definitional challenges in our terminology. What exactly do we mean by "programs," "software," and "source code"? Though often used interchangeably, each term has distinct meanings: source code refers to human-readable instructions intended to be executed by the machine; software encompasses the broader ecosystem including compiled programs, documentation, and user interfaces; programs typically denote the executable files that run on computers. 

### 1.b Born-Digital Heritage: How Source Code Gained Official Recognition - 20 min

Let's explore how source code became recognized as cultural heritage. The 2003 UNESCO Charter on the Preservation of Digital Heritage represented a significant milestone in this journey. It formally acknowledged that born-digital materials—content that originates in digital form—constitute an important part of our cultural legacy. These materials include databases, websites, software, and other digital content that have never existed in physical form.
Why was this recognition important? By officially affirming the historical and cultural value of digital materials, UNESCO effectively placed them on equal footing with traditional heritage forms like monuments and artifacts, highlighting their significance for future generations.

However, it did not explicitly address source code preservation ([UNESCO 2009](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000179529)). How did this evolve? It wasn't until 2023 that UNESCO clearly articulated the importance of preserving software source code as digital heritage for sustainable development, acknowledging its value across multiple domains: education, research, and cultural preservation ([UNESCO 2023](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/positioning-software-source-code-digital-heritage-sustainable-development)).

**Exercise – Analyzing UNESCO's Recognition of Source Code**

Now, let's explore two documents to gain a better understanding of how digital heritage recognition has evolved over time and the challenges faced by preservation efforts. These readings will help you grasp the historical context and current thinking around source code preservation.

* [Charter on the Preservation of the Digital Heritage (2003)](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000179529) - Focus on definitions and scope (sections 1-3)
* ['Positioning Software Source Code as Digital Heritage for Sustainable Development' (2023)](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/positioning-software-source-code-digital-heritage-sustainable-development)

Questions for reflection:

1. How does the 2003 Charter define digital heritage, and where might source code fit within this definition? Consider the language used and the types of materials mentioned.
2. Looking at the 2023 UNESCO article, what specific arguments are presented for treating source code as heritage? How has this perspective evolved over the twenty years since the original Charter?
3. What specific benefits does code preservation offer to society, and in which fields (legacy, research, etc.) is it recognized as having particular value?

### 1.c The Fragility of Code: Understanding Digital Preservation Challenges - 15 minutes

Among the key threats to source code is the potential for a Digital Dark Age ([Silva 2022](https://www.softwareheritage.org/2022/06/28/all-of-humankinds-source-code-in-a-nutshell/?lang=fr)), which refers to the possible loss of vast amounts of digital information. To understand this concept better, let's examine three main factors that contribute to this risk:

* Technological obsolescence: When hardware and software systems become outdated
* Platform changes: When services hosting code shut down or significantly change
* The ephemeral nature of digital storage: Digital media degrades over time

Why should we care about preserving historical code? This question is critical for historians and cultural preservationists to consider. Digital materials require intentional and continuous preservation strategies ([Conway 1996](https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/conway2/index/)). Source code faces particular vulnerabilities: programming languages evolve, development platforms disappear, and the original context of creation can be lost within years of a program's abandonment.

Consider the case of early video games, where entire genres and artistic movements have been lost because the original source code was not preserved ([Lowood 2016](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5223982)). Many classic arcade games like Jet Set Willy ([Aycock et al. 2017](https://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue45/2/index.html)) survive only as reverse-engineered approximations after their original code was lost through corporate restructuring, technological changes, or simple neglect. Likewise, early web applications, mobile apps, and desktop software that fundamentally shaped our computer interactions have disappeared, taking with them vital evidence of digital culture's evolution ([Kirschenbaum and Ovenden 2014](https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub149/)).

This loss extends far beyond just individual programs - it affects entire development ecosystems. Think of it like this: as programming languages become obsolete and development tools disappear, the specialized knowledge of working with these particular systems gradually scatters as communities evolve and move on to newer technologies ([Shustek 2006](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4042496)). The resulting impact is both technical and cultural in nature: we lose valuable access to the creative processes that developers used, the collaborative practices they established, and the innovative solutions they created - all of which defined significant periods in computing history.

Amid these losses, remarkable stories of recovery and reconstruction offer hope. The Apollo 11 source code, once considered lost, was meticulously reconstructed from printed documentation and surviving fragments—a case we will examine in detail in Section 2. Such recoveries reveal not just technical achievement but the working methods, naming conventions, and even humor embedded by programming teams. These discoveries provide unique insights into computing culture that descriptive historical sources alone could never capture.

**Exercise – Examining some Heritage Needs and Efforts**

In this activity, you will compare and analyze two perspectives on code preservation. Read both articles carefully to identify their approaches to digital heritage preservation and the challenges they address.

* [I tried to find a way to preserve code for 69 years (this is not a joke)](https://museumofscreens.wordpress.com/2022/12/09/how-to-preserve-code-for-69-years-this-is-not-a-joke/) 
* [Vanishing Culture: Recovering Lost Software](https://blog.archive.org/2025/05/07/vanishing-culture-recovering-lost-software/)

Questions for reflection:

1. Identify common elements: What shared goals, concerns, and types of code do both articles discuss?
2. Analyze preservation challenges: What specific technical and cultural obstacles do both authors encounter in their preservation efforts?
3. Compare methodological approaches: How do their different approaches reflect the broader challenge of code preservation?

## 2 Learning to Read Code as Cultural Text

Understanding source code as a historical source requires developing new literacy skills that bridge technical and cultural analysis. Source code is fundamentally a form of writing—a way humans communicate instructions, ideas, and solutions to both computers and other humans. Like other written forms, it bears the marks of its author's background, the conventions of its era, and its cultural context. Programming languages function similarly to human languages in that they have their own grammar, style conventions, and cultural associations that evolve across different communities and historical periods.

### 2.a Source Criticism in the Digital Age - 25 minutes

Approaching code as a historical source does not require you to become a programmer—but it does require developing a new kind of literacy. Just as art historians learn to see paintings differently than casual viewers, and musicologists learn to hear compositions with trained attention, historians of computing must learn to read code with awareness of its technical, textual, and cultural dimensions simultaneously. This lesson develops that awareness without assuming prior programming experience, while recognizing that code is not simply "text in another language" but a distinctive form of human expression with its own material and logical properties.

The relationship between historical analysis and technical understanding operates at several levels:

* **Reading code as cultural text** does not require programming expertise—you can analyze naming conventions, comments, documentation practices, and embedded cultural references without being able to write or execute code yourself.
* **Understanding what code does** benefits from basic familiarity with programming concepts—not expertise, but enough literacy to recognize structures, follow logic, and understand why certain choices were made.
* **Evaluating code's technical quality or reconstructing functionality** requires genuine programming knowledge—a level beyond what this lesson addresses.

This lesson focuses primarily on the first level while acknowledging that deeper engagement benefits from the second.

**The Inheritance of Source Criticism**

Historians trained in source criticism will recognize familiar questions when approaching code: Who created this? When? For what purpose? Has it been altered? Can we trust it? These questions remain essential. Traditional source criticism distinguishes between:

* **External criticism:** establishing authenticity, provenance, dating, transmission
* **Internal criticism:** interpreting content, meaning, context

**The Entanglement Problem**

In born-digital sources, this distinction becomes complicated. Code often contains its own metadata—the artifact documents itself. Comments embed provenance information. Version histories record transmission. Cultural references sit alongside technical instructions. The boundary between document and documentation collapses.

This is not a failure of method but a characteristic of digital heritage requiring adapted approaches. As scholars of digital historiography have argued, born-digital sources possess different material properties than traditional documents: reproducibility without degradation, dependency on technical infrastructure, and the embedding of multiple temporalities within single artifacts ([Fickers 2012](https://jethc.eu/index.php/jethc/article/view/jethc015); [Kirschenbaum 2008](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262517409/mechanisms/)).

**The Layered Reading Approach**

Rather than applying external and internal criticism sequentially, we propose a **layered reading** that holds multiple dimensions simultaneously:

1. **Code as technical object** – what it does, how it functions
2. **Code as textual artifact** – what it says, how it communicates
3. **Code as historical trace** – what contexts it embeds
4. **Code as archival construction** – how it reached us, what interventions shaped it

These layers are concurrent, not sequential. A single element—a function name, a comment, a formatting choice—may speak to all four dimensions at once. As Mark Marino argues in *Critical Code Studies* (2020), we must attend to "the extra-functional significance of computer source code"—what code means beyond what it does.

Source code has emerged as a valuable resource for humanities research, particularly in critical code studies, digital history, and science and technology studies. Pioneer work in this field began in the early 2000s ([Mackenzie 2006](https://books.google.lu/books?id=083BUgMnLKQC); [Manovich 2001;](https://dss-edit.com/plu/Manovich-Lev_The_Language_of_the_New_Media.pdf) [Fuller 2008)](https://monoskop.org/images/a/a1/Fuller_Matthew_ed_Software_Studies_A_Lexicon.pdf), with notable contributions along the way ([Coleman 2018](https://thesai.org/Publications/ViewPaper?Volume=9&Issue=9&Code=ijacsa&SerialNo=2); [Cox and McLean 2012](https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/3964/Speaking-CodeCoding-as-Aesthetic-and-Political); [Berry 2016](https://books.google.lu/books?id=GeYgDAAAQBAJ); [Rushkoff 2010](https://books.google.lu/books?id=e2YCuxBjkq0C); [Hayles 2005](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3622698.html)). The 2020 publication of the [Manifesto for Critical Code Studies](https://books.google.fr/books?id=k4LPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=copyright&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false), enriched with detailed case studies, further developed the exploration of code as cultural expression. These initiatives treat programming languages as forms of creative writing, examine the cultural assumptions embedded in algorithms, and investigate how software development practices reflect broader social and political contexts.

These works reveal how seemingly neutral technical decisions actually reflect cultural biases, political assumptions, and aesthetic preferences. By examining code as a form of cultural expression, scholars can explore questions about power, identity, and creativity in digital environments.

**Key Analytical Questions**

When approaching any code artifact, consider the following dimensions:

**Establishing Provenance and Authenticity:** When encountering code, begin with fundamental questions of authenticity: Who wrote this code? When was it created? Where did it originate? How did it reach us? Just as historians carefully verify the authenticity of manuscripts or documents, we must establish the credible origins of code. Sometimes, proprietary source code becomes available through unauthorized leaks. For example, in 2023, portions of Twitter's source code were leaked on GitHub, revealing aspects of their recommendation algorithm ([Yu 2023](https://www.wowebsites.com/blog/2023/04/twitter-algorithm-code-leaked-and-released-an-explanation/)).

**Question the broader context.** When and why was this code written? In what environment? What problem did it address? What technological constraints existed? Can you create a technological genealogy? You can then deepen the provenance and authenticity aspect from further analysis.

**Dependencies and Networks:** You should examine what external code a program relies on as it reveals networks of collaboration and influence. Like citations in academic papers, dependencies show how programmers built upon existing work and participated in broader development communities. For example, the Internet is so dependent on Open Source code that in 2016 a single developer was capable of breaking the Internet for several minutes by suppressing 11 lines of code ([Collins 2016](https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code)).

**Linguistic and Cultural Markers:** Just as a historian might analyze handwriting or paper type, we can examine source code for cultural fingerprints:

* Naming conventions: Variable names like "colorPreference" versus "couleurPreference" can reveal a developer's native language
* Comments: The style and thoroughness of documentation often reflects cultural attitudes toward collaboration
* Programming style: How code is structured and formatted can indicate where and how a developer was trained

> The use of English-based keywords in programming languages like "if," "else," "for," and "while" reflects the dominance of English-speaking countries in early computing history, creating barriers for non-native English speakers. Cultural factors influence programming language design. Some languages tend toward straightforward, more explicit or verbose syntax with clear variable declarations ([Walton 2024](https://rotel.pressbooks.pub/culturally-responsive-computing/chapter/the-culture-of-programming/)).

**Code structure and style:** Think of code as having its own "writing style," just like how authors have different ways of organizing their paragraphs and sentences. When examining historical code, pay attention to how it's organized and formatted. This can tell us a lot about:

* The development environment: Well-structured, clean code with consistent indentation and naming often indicates professional settings with established coding standards
* The development context: Code that appears hastily written might reveal academic prototypes, emergency fixes, or situations where speed was prioritized over elegance
* The programmer's background: Just as handwriting reveals personality traits, coding style can reflect a developer's training and experience

> To better understand what "good code structure" looks like in different contexts, you can explore resources like the [MIT Coding and Comment Style guide](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/coding-and-comment-style/), which explains coding conventions used in professional and academic settings.

**Comments and documentation:** Think of comments as the programmer's personal notes and explanations within the code. Comments are portions of text embedded within source code that the compiler or interpreter ignores during execution. These human-readable annotations provide direct windows into their thinking process. Pay attention to how comments explain debugging approaches, clarify complex algorithms, document team decisions, and sometimes include personal reflections or humor that humanizes the technical work.

**Intended audience.** Ask yourself: Is the code written for experienced technical experts or newcomers to programming? Does it include detailed comments that explain complex concepts, or assume prior knowledge? By analyzing these audience considerations, you can better understand broader issues of technological accessibility and the boundaries between different technical communities.

> Code documentation reveals its intended audience through the level of explanation provided. For instance, code intended for expert JavaScript developers typically contains minimal, technical comments assuming significant prior knowledge, while code designed for beginners includes extensive explanations of basic concepts and step-by-step logic ([Emadamerho-Atori, 2024](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/how-to-write-code-documentation/)).

**Political Dimensions and Power Structures:** Code doesn't exist in a political vacuum - it reflects and shapes power relationships. Who has access to this code? What assumptions about users are embedded in its design? How does it distribute agency between users and systems? The choice between open source and proprietary models reflects different philosophies about technological power and knowledge sharing.

> The ongoing dispute between France and India over Rafale fighter jet source code exemplifies how code embodies political power structures in defense technology. India urgently seeks access to part of the source code of the Rafale, which forms the aircraft's electronic backbone ([Dasgupta, 2025](https://www.india.com/business/what-is-source-code-why-is-it-crucial-for-fighter-planes-know-its-role-in-missile-integration-and-upgrades-7849472/)). This represents a broader tension between India's "Atmanirbhar Bharat" (Self-Reliant India) initiative and Western defense contractors' business model.

**Cross-referencing and Comparative Analysis:** Just as historians cross-reference multiple sources, code analysis benefits from comparing similar programs from the same period, examining related documentation, or studying the broader software ecosystem. Look for corroborating evidence in contemporary technical manuals, industry publications, or other preserved codebases.

**Don't forget to consider what's absent or missing from the code.** What programming practices, security measures, or accessibility features that we might expect today are missing? Sometimes what code doesn't include reveals as much about historical context as what it does. These gaps can highlight evolving standards and changing priorities in software development over time.

> Consider the example of the systematic exclusion of the six women who programmed ENIAC for decades from historical documentation. It demonstrates how what is missing reveals as much as what's included ([Light 1999](https://rybn.org/human_computers/articles/when_computers_were_women.pdf)). This gap in the historical record wasn't accidental but reflected broader societal attitudes that marginalized women's technical contributions, showing how the absence of documentation can be as historically significant as its presence ([MacDonald 2016](https://www.sciencealert.com/these-6-women-were-written-out-of-tech-history)).

### 2.b Programming Languages as Historical Markers - 30 minutes

Programming languages provide crucial chronological and cultural markers. Each language connects to specific communities, time periods, and technological constraints:

* **FORTRAN** indicates scientific/academic origins from the 1950s-60s
* **Assembly language** points to system-level programming across various eras, requiring intimate knowledge of specific hardware
* **BASIC** suggests educational contexts and early personal computing (1970s-80s)
* **JavaScript** indicates web development post-1995
* **Python** reflects contemporary emphases on readability and accessibility

The use of English-based keywords in programming languages like "if," "else," "for," and "while" reflects the dominance of English-speaking countries in early computing history, creating barriers for non-native English speakers. Cultural factors influence programming language design. Some languages tend toward straightforward, more explicit or verbose syntax with clear variable declarations ([Walton 2024](https://rotel.pressbooks.pub/culturally-responsive-computing/chapter/the-culture-of-programming/)).

**Rosetta Code: A Comparative Resource**

The [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Text) repository provides a unique resource for understanding programming languages as historical artifacts. It collects implementations of the same simple program—"Hello, World!"—in over 300 programming languages, organized chronologically from early mainframe languages through modern languages.

By comparing how different languages accomplish the identical task, we can observe:

* How language design reflects different philosophical approaches (Python's emphasis on readability vs. C's minimalism)
* The influence of specific communities and time periods on language design
* How constraints of different eras (punch cards, limited memory, specific hardware) shaped programming practices
* The evolution from hardware-constrained verbosity to higher abstraction

**Brief exploration:** Visit [Rosetta Code's Hello World collection](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Text) and compare implementations across three eras:

* A 1950s-60s language (FORTRAN, COBOL, or Assembly)
* A 1970s-80s language (C, Pascal, or BASIC)
* A modern language (Python, JavaScript, or Ruby)

What differences do you notice in verbosity, structure, and assumptions about the programmer?

**Case Study: Microsoft GW-BASIC (1975-1983)**

Let us now apply the layered reading approach to a specific code artifact. Examine this snippet:

```
; [ This translation created 10-Feb-83 by Version 4.3 ]

    .RADIX    8        ; To be safe

CSEG    SEGMENT PUBLIC 'CODESG'

```

**Exercise – Analyzing the GW-BASIC Code**

Apply the layered reading approach:

1. **Identify the layers:** What information in this snippet addresses each dimension (technical object, textual artifact, historical trace, archival construction)? Notice how these overlap—the copyright notice is simultaneously technical (comment syntax), textual (attribution language), and historical (1975 date).

2. **Provenance and dating:** Who is credited as author? What dates appear? The code was "originally written" in 1975 but "translated" in 1983. What does this eight-year gap suggest about software evolution and the need for code translation as environments change?

3. **Programming language context:** Looking at the title "GWMAIN" and knowing this is early Microsoft code, what might "GW" stand for? (Hint: Think of a simple programming language designed to be easy for beginners.) What does the assembly language format tell us about the relationship between high-level and low-level code?

4. **Cultural markers:** Examine how credit is attributed: "wrote a lot of stuff," "wrote a lot of other stuff and fast code." What does this informal, almost playful language reveal about early software culture and workplace dynamics?

5. **Cross-referencing:** Consult these contemporary sources:
   * [James, Mike. 2025 'Bill Gates Shares The Code That Launched Microsoft'. I Programmer](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17946-bill-gates-shares-the-code-that-launched-microsoft.html)
   * [Gates, Bill. 2025. 'Celebrating 50 Years of Microsoft'. Gates Notes.](https://www.gatesnotes.com/home/home-page-topic/reader/microsoft-original-source-code)
   
   How does Gates describe this collaboration in 2025 versus the 1983 code comments? What additional historical significance do these sources attribute to this early work?

### 2.c The Journey of the Apollo Code: Preservation, Heritagization, and Hidden Histories - 40 minutes

The software that guided Apollo 11 to the moon nearly disappeared. Unlike the spacecraft hardware—preserved in museums, celebrated in documentaries—the source code existed only as printed listings, vulnerable to the same forces of neglect, institutional change, and physical decay that threaten all paper documents. For decades, the Apollo Guidance Computer software survived in fragments: some listings in archives, some in private collections, much of it scattered or lost.

This is not unusual. Most software from the 1960s and 1970s has vanished entirely. What makes the Apollo code exceptional is not that it survived, but that dedicated individuals reconstructed it, digitized it, and made it accessible—transforming working code into digital heritage. In tracing this journey, we will see how code becomes heritage, what is gained and transformed in the process, and what looking beyond the code itself can reveal about the social dimensions of software engineering.

**Pause and reflect:** Before we examine the code itself, consider: what does it mean for code to become "heritage"? What changes when a program moves from being a working tool to being a historical artifact? Keep these questions in mind as we trace the Apollo code's journey.

**The Digital Archive: Encountering the Code Today**

Today, you can access the Apollo 11 source code on GitHub. Visit the repository and examine the header of the file named `BURN_BABY_BURN--MASTER_IGNITION_ROUTINE.agc`:

# BURN, BABY, BURN -- MASTER IGNITION ROUTINE
```

**First analysis task:** Before reading further, examine this header carefully. Can you distinguish between:

* Information that was part of the **original 1969 code**
* Information added during **digitization and transcription** (2009)
* Information from **oral history** (the 40th anniversary story)

What visual or textual markers help you make these distinctions?

**Markers of Heritagization: What the Header Reveals**

The header is a layered document—a palimpsest where different historical moments coexist. Let us identify the markers of heritagization:

**Original historical content:**

* The routine name: `BURN, BABY, BURN -- MASTER IGNITION ROUTINE`
* The assembly timestamp: `16:27 JULY 14, 1969`
* The program identifier: `AGC program LMY99 by NASA`

**Reconstruction and transcription metadata:**

* Transcriber identification: `Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>`
* Modification history: dates, initials (RSB), specific changes
* Source documentation: "transcribed or otherwise adapted from digitized images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum"
* Provenance chain: Paul Fjeld (digitization), Deborah Douglas (MIT Museum), ibiblio.org

**Added historical context (metadata on the metadata):**

* The Magnificent Montague story, added July 2009
* Attribution: "Onno's notes... which he got from Don Eyles"
* The 40th anniversary gathering as source

**Notice the clear separation:** The header uses different comment markers (`#` vs `##`) to distinguish between transcription notes and added historical context. This transparency is itself a marker of careful heritagization—the archive documents its own construction.

**Second analysis task:** The header notes that Ron Burkey "Corrected 3 typos" in June 2009. What does this tell us about the relationship between the GitHub file and the 1969 original? Is this file "the same" as the historical code? How should historians think about such corrections?

**The Physical Artifact: Tracing Back to Paper**

![Original source code page 731 of Luminary 099 from Apollo 11, showing the beginning of the BURN_BABY_BURN master ignition routine](/assets/images/code-as-heritage/apollo-11-luminary-099-page-731.jpg "Page 731 of Luminary 099: BURN_BABY_BURN--MASTER_IGNITION_ROUTINE")

**Figure 4:** Original scanned page 731 from the Luminary 099 source code listing for Apollo 11's Lunar Module Guidance Computer, showing the beginning of the BURN_BABY_BURN--MASTER_IGNITION_ROUTINE. This hardcopy listing, digitized from the MIT Museum archives, represents one of the most important preserved examples of space program source code. *Source: [ibiblio.org Apollo Archive](http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ScansForConversion/Luminary099/), digitized from MIT Museum collections*

Compare this image to the GitHub header. The printed listing shows:

* The physical format: continuous-feed paper, monospace typeface
* Page numbers printed on the document itself
* The assembly notation as it appeared in 1969
* No explanatory metadata—the code was documentation enough for its original users

**Third analysis task:** What is present in the GitHub version that is absent from the original listing? What is present in the original that the digital version cannot fully capture? Consider both informational content and material qualities.

**Humor in Mission-Critical Code**

The routine's name demands attention: BURN_BABY_BURN. This was not a placeholder or informal label—it was the official identifier for the master ignition routine that controlled the Lunar Module's engine during descent to the moon.

The header tells us the name "traces back to 1965 and the Los Angeles riots, and was inspired by disc jockey extraordinaire and radio station owner Magnificent Montague," who used the phrase when playing hit records. The catchphrase became associated with the Watts riots, taking on more charged meanings—yet NASA programmers embedded it in the code that would land humans on the moon.

This is not an anomaly. Research by Deepika Tiwari, Benoit Baudry, and Martin Monperrus at KTH found that humor has always been present in software development: "What surprised us most when we started looking for humour in software is that it has always been there. Even in the Apollo mission code, we found jokes" ([KTH 2021](https://www.kth.se/en/eecs/nyheter/humor-en-viktig-ingrediens-i-mjukvaruutveckling-1.1351788)).

**Fourth analysis task:** What does the presence of cultural humor in mission-critical code suggest about:

* The relationship between technical work and human expression?
* The working culture of 1960s aerospace programming?
* What "professionalism" meant in this context?

**The Human Context: Margaret Hamilton and the Question of Recognition**

![Margaret Hamilton standing beside software code listings for the Apollo program](/assets/images/code-as-heritage/Margaret_Hamilton_-_restoration.jpg "Margaret Hamilton with Apollo source code, 1969")

**Figure 5:** Margaret Hamilton in 1969, standing beside the printed source code listings she and her MIT team produced for the Apollo program's Lunar Module and Command Module. This iconic photograph demonstrates how source code itself can be a historical artifact and document of human achievement in computing. *Credit: Draper Laboratory, Public Domain, via [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Margaret_Hamilton_-_restoration.jpg)*

This iconic photograph shows Margaret Hamilton, director of the Software Engineering Division at MIT's Instrumentation Laboratory, beside stacks of printed listings. The BURN_BABY_BURN routine was part of the larger software system her team developed.

Hamilton's story illuminates what code preservation can and cannot capture. The GitHub header credits Don Eyles and Peter Adler as "authors of this routine." Hamilton led the division; her name does not appear in this file. This is not an error—Eyles and Adler wrote this specific routine—but it reflects how code documents certain kinds of authorship while obscuring others.

The systematic underrecognition of women's contributions to computing has been well documented. Jennifer Light's study "When Computers Were Women" (1999) showed how the six women who programmed ENIAC were largely written out of history for decades ([Light 1999](https://rybn.org/human_computers/articles/when_computers_were_women.pdf)). This gap in the historical record wasn't accidental but reflected broader societal attitudes that marginalized women's technical contributions ([MacDonald 2016](https://www.sciencealert.com/these-6-women-were-written-out-of-tech-history)).

Hamilton herself had to advocate for recognition of software engineering as a legitimate discipline—she is credited with coining the term. In a field where software was often dismissed as less important than hardware, and where women's technical contributions were frequently overlooked, Hamilton had to advocate for both her discipline and her team's recognition.

**Fifth analysis task:** The Apollo code's journey from working software to digital heritage involved many decisions about what to preserve, transcribe, and contextualize. Whose labor is visible in the GitHub repository? Whose labor made the code possible but remains invisible? What sources beyond the code itself would you need to recover a fuller picture?

**From Paper to Software Heritage: The Arc of Heritagization**

The Apollo code's journey—from working software (1969) to archived printouts (MIT Museum) to digitized images (Paul Fjeld) to transcribed files (Ron Burkey) to GitHub repository to Software Heritage—exemplifies how software becomes heritage.

Each stage transformed the artifact:

* **Archival survival** depended on institutional decisions and individual collectors
* **Digitization** made the code accessible but reduced image quality
* **Transcription** made the code searchable and executable (via emulators) but introduced interpretive choices
* **Contextualization** added historical information but also shaped how future users encounter the code
* **Platform migration** (GitHub, Software Heritage) ensures persistence but embeds the code in new infrastructures with their own assumptions

**Synthesis reflection:** Having traced this journey, return to the questions posed at the beginning: What does it mean for code to become "heritage"? What changes when a program moves from being a working tool to being a historical artifact? How has your understanding evolved?

### 2.d Code as Cultural Expression: Esoteric Languages and Creative Programming - 20 minutes

The examples we have examined so far—GW-BASIC, Apollo guidance software—were created for practical purposes. But programming has always had creative and playful dimensions. Even in mission-critical Apollo code, we found cultural humor embedded in technical work.

Some programmers take this further, creating languages and programs whose primary purpose is expression rather than utility. These reveal programming as a form of cultural practice irreducible to its technical functions.

**Esoteric Programming Languages**

Esoteric programming languages (or "esolangs") are intentionally designed not for practical software development, but rather to challenge conventional programming paradigms and provide amusement for programmers ([Paloque-Bergès 2009](https://www.laprocure.com/product/1282150/paloque-berges-camille-poetique-des-codes-sur-le-reseau-informatique)). Think of them as programming's equivalent to experimental art or wordplay—they serve as creative expressions, intellectual puzzles, or even jokes that reveal the playful and cultural dimensions of programming beyond its purely functional aspects.

**The Esoteric File Archive**

Explore the [Esoteric File Archive repository](https://github.com/graue/esofiles), a digital repository dedicated to preserving these unusual programming languages that might otherwise be lost to digital obsolescence. As the archive's creator explains in their own words: "websites devoted to esoteric programming languages tended to periodically go down... people who wanted to check out that language were out of luck" (Feeney [2013] 2025)

Simple exploration steps:

1. Browse the repository folders (hunter, chef, shakespeare, befunge, etc.)
2. Open one language folder that interests you
3. Look at the code examples and documentation

For example, let's examine the [hunter folder](https://github.com/graue/esofiles/tree/master/hunter) and its [documentation](https://github.com/graue/esofiles/blob/master/hunter/doc/hunter.txt) file. Here you'll discover a fascinating programming language created by Chris Pressey in 2000 where programs are visualized as "mice in a space interacting with cheese and each other" (Pressey 2000). 

                Concurrent Maze Space Transformation
              (with Authentic Interrodent Communication)
                 In The HUNTER Programming Language


It is perceived that one of the biggest problems in maintaining
interest in programming is the above linear growth of boredom
compared to the usefulness of the program, resulting in an
acute loss of enthusiasm on the part of the programmers and
ultimately the abandonment of the software.

This creative approach wasn't just for amusement - it was actually designed to address "the problem of programmer boredom leading to the abandonment of software" (Esolang, 2025). By making programming more engaging and playful, Pressey hoped to encourage longer-term maintenance of software projects.

**Reflection questions:**

* Why would programmers invest time and effort to create seemingly "useless" languages and then work collaboratively to preserve them?
* What insights does this archive provide about programming as a form of cultural expression and creativity, beyond its practical problem-solving applications?

**BONUS Exercise: Code as Archaeological Evidence**

Reading: [David M. Berry's "Digital Ruins and Critical Code Studies: Towards an Ethics of Historical Software Reconstruction"](https://stunlaw.blogspot.com/2025/01/digital-ruins-and-critical-code-studies.html)

**Analysis questions:** After reading Berry's discussion of "digital ruins," consider:

1. **Historical parallels:** Berry compares software reconstruction to architectural preservation. Identify two specific principles from architectural preservation (mentioned in the text) that he argues should apply to code reconstruction. How do these principles address the challenge of maintaining historical authenticity?
2. **Evidence evaluation:** In the ELIZA reconstruction case study, the team had to create entirely new functions (like LETTER and BCDIT) that were missing from the original archives. According to Berry's framework, how should such reconstructions be marked or documented to distinguish them from original historical code?

## 3 Preserving Code: Initiatives and Infrastructures

Having explored code preservation challenges and historical analysis techniques, let's now turn our attention to actual archiving initiatives. In this section, we will examine how different institutions with different values and missions have approached the challenge of preserving software heritage. Understanding these institutional contexts helps us interpret their choices and recognize what each approach captures and what it may miss.

### 3.a Software Heritage: Mission, Scope and Infrastructure - 30 minutes

Software Heritage emerged from academic research culture. Founded in France in 2016 by Roberto Di Cosmo (a computer science professor) with institutional support from the National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA), it reflects scholarly values: comprehensive collection, rigorous documentation, persistent citation through identifiers, and open access. Its organizational model—a nonprofit foundation with academic, governmental, and industry partners—prioritizes long-term preservation over commercial considerations. The initiative's publications appear in academic venues; its methods are documented for scholarly scrutiny.

Think of Software Heritage as a response to an important assessment: preserving source code isn't something that can be done through individual, scattered efforts. Instead, it requires well-organized, institutional approaches ([Di Cosmo and Zacchiroli 2017](https://www.softwareheritage.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ipres-2017-swh.pdf)). To understand its focus, imagine a library that aims to collect all publicly available books - Software Heritage does this for open source code, though it cannot include proprietary code that is legally protected. Despite this necessary limitation, the archive has still managed to collect an impressive collection of millions of software projects and repositories.

Software Heritage aims to preserve everything publicly available. This comprehensive approach is like preserving an entire ecosystem rather than just a few species. Why does this matter? Because historical significance often isn't apparent immediately. By preserving the complete landscape of software development, future researchers will have access to much richer historical evidence than they would with a more selective approach.

**Technical Architecture**

Think of Software Heritage's interface as a library with a special organization system designed for two key purposes: safeguarding code for future generations while making it accessible for today's researchers and developers. The platform organizes preserved code into three fundamental levels:

* Source files: The individual pieces of code 
* Commits: Snapshots of code at specific moments in time
* Projects: Complete software repositories

This three-tier organization mirrors how software development works in practice, providing stable reference points that historians and researchers can use for consistent analysis.

When exploring Software Heritage, you will find search and browsing tools that open up multiple pathways for historical investigation. One limitation is that the archive lacks currently intuitive browsing capabilities, making it difficult to explore without specific search criteria in mind. If you have one, you could, for example, track how specific algorithms have evolved over decades, examine shifts in programming practices across different time periods, or map out the collaborative networks behind major software projects.

What makes this archive particularly valuable for scholarly work is its system of persistent identifiers - these function like permanent citation codes, ensuring that references to code remain valid indefinitely. This solves a crucial problem in digital scholarship ([Cosmo et al. 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946737/)) that researchers in other fields, such as web archiving, have similarly struggled with - how to create stable, lasting references to digital materials that might otherwise change or disappear.

**Exercise: Understanding Software Heritage's Development** 

To better understand how Software Heritage developed into a major preservation initiative, explore these complementary resources:

*[Note: The Schafer 2017 source below is in French. This exercise will be revised to include English-language alternatives.]*

* [Schafer, Valérie (2017). 'Le Logiciel Libre, de l'usage à La Recherche, Entretien avec Roberto Di Cosmo'. Bulletin 1024, 39-52.](https://1024.socinfo.fr/2017/09/1024_11_2017_39.html)

Focus particularly on pages 49 onward, where Di Cosmo discusses the founding vision and early challenges of Software Heritage.

Then examine this milestone report to see how the project matured:

* [Cosmo, Roberto Di. 2022. 'Software Heritage in 2021: Five Years Already!' Software Heritage, January 5.](https://www.softwareheritage.org/2022/01/05/software-heritage-in-2021-five-years-already/)

**Guided reflection questions:**

1. Who were the key figures in founding Software Heritage, and what specific problems were they trying to solve with this initiative?
2. How has the project evolved by 2021 in terms of institutional support, technical infrastructure, and preservation achievements?

**Exercise: Navigating Software Heritage**

Let's explore the Software Heritage archive together. First, visit the homepage: www.softwareheritage.org

**Step 1: Quick analysis:** As you examine the website, identify and take notes on how the platform communicates these three key aspects:

* Its heritage mission (What problem is it trying to solve? Why preserve code?)
* Community engagement opportunities (How can visitors contribute to this preservation effort?)
* The types and categories of code within Software Heritage's preservation scope

**Step 2: Features exploration:** Next, navigate to the features page: www.softwareheritage.org/software-heritage-features/ In your notes, categorize which features specifically address:

* Searchability and discovery (How do researchers find what they need?)	
* Long-term preservation strategies (How does the archive ensure code remains accessible decades from now?)

**Critical thinking questions:** After your exploration, consider these deeper questions:

1. How does the three-tier organization system ("Source Files," "Commits," and "Projects") mirror actual software development workflows? How might this organizational approach benefit different types of historical research?
2. Why are persistent identifiers so crucial for digital scholarship? How do they address challenges we discussed in Section 2 regarding code as archival construction?

### 3.b Comparative Preservation Approaches - 25 minutes

Software Heritage represents one approach to digital preservation. To better understand the field, let's compare it with initiatives that emerge from different institutional contexts and reflect different values. Think of these different preservation strategies as similar to how museums, libraries, and archives might each preserve cultural artifacts differently. Each approach has unique strengths and limitations that reflect their specific preservation goals and institutional missions.

**GitHub Archive Program: A Corporate Initiative**

The GitHub Archive Program represents a different institutional logic. GitHub, owned by Microsoft since 2018, is a commercial platform where most of the world's open-source development now takes place. The Archive Program—including the Arctic Code Vault—serves multiple purposes: genuine preservation, corporate social responsibility, and platform legitimation. This is not criticism but context: understanding *who* preserves code and *why* shapes how we interpret preservation choices.

Launched in 2020, the program creates secure, long-term backups through multiple storage methods - think of it as creating several types of time capsules simultaneously. Perhaps most fascinating is the [Arctic Code Vault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v9Rwqxa8eI), housed in an abandoned mine deep within Svalbard's Arctic archipelago, where code is stored in a facility designed to last centuries.

![GitHub Open Source Archive Box with AI-generated design](/assets/images/code-as-heritage/GitHub_Archive_Box.png "GitHub Archive Box")

**Figure 7:** A museum-quality archival case designed by artist and engineer Alex Maki-Jokela for the GitHub Archive Program. The box features 3D-printed and AI-generated artwork, and contains 17,000 open-source repositories archived on hardened film designed to survive 1,000 years. The aesthetic design reflects an important principle: that preservation efforts must be valued as objects in themselves to ensure long-term commitment to heritage protection. *Credit: GitHub Archive Program, Design by Alex Maki-Jokela, via [GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/greatest-hits/)*

**Figure 8:** The entrance to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, an underground facility in the Arctic designed to preserve plant seeds for centuries. The GitHub Arctic Code Vault was intentionally placed near this seed vault as a conceptual parallel—both preserve humanity's most precious biological and digital heritage in a location designed to survive catastrophic changes. *Credit: Bjoertvedt, [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), via [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Svalbard_seed_vault_IMG_8894.JPG)*

What makes this approach educationally valuable is its concept of "pace layers" - different preservation methods designed to function across various time scales, from years to millennia. This layered approach helps ensure that our digital heritage remains accessible to future generations regardless of technological changes ([GitHub Archive Program 2025](https://archiveprogram.github.com/)).

**Internet Archive Software Collection: The Pioneer Spirit**

The Internet Archive, founded by Brewster Kahle in 1996, embodies the idealism of early internet culture—the belief that digital technology could democratize access to human knowledge. Its motto, "Universal Access to All Knowledge," reflects this founding vision. 

While Software Heritage focuses primarily on preserving source code (the building blocks of software), the Internet Archive takes a different approach. It preserves the complete software experience by collecting not just executable programs, but also their accompanying documentation, media, and cultural artifacts that help users understand the historical context in which the software was actually used. Think of this as preserving not just a historical building, but also photographs, newspapers, and artifacts showing how people lived in and interacted with that building. 

This holistic collection ranges from early personal computer applications to beloved classic arcade games, and importantly, offers something unique for hands-on learning: emulated environments where users can actively experience the software functioning as it did decades ago, rather than just passively viewing static code ([Internet Archive 2025](https://archive.org/details/software)).

**Comparing Approaches**

To understand the different approaches to software preservation, consider this analogy: If software were a book, these preservation strategies would focus on different aspects:

1. Source code preservation (Software Heritage): Preserves the "manuscript" (human-readable instructions and collaborative development processes)
2. Archive storage (GitHub Arctic Vault): Creates secure "vaults" that protect against catastrophic loss
3. Executable preservation (Internet Archive): Maintains the "reading experience" (how users actually interacted with the software)

Each approach preserves a unique dimension of software as cultural heritage, and together they provide a more complete historical record ([Matthews *et al.* 2010](https://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/145/210)).

| Initiative | Institutional Base | Primary Values | Preservation Focus |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Software Heritage** | Academic/Research | Comprehensiveness, citation, scholarly access | Source code as text |
| **GitHub Archive Program** | Corporate | Longevity, redundancy, visibility | Source code as files |
| **Internet Archive** | Nonprofit/Pioneer | Universal access, experiential preservation | Software as experience |

**Exercise: Comparing Preservation Strategies** 

In this structured activity, you'll analyze three different approaches to software preservation, each with unique strengths and philosophies.

**Part 1: GitHub Archive Program**

Visit and carefully examine: archiveprogram.github.com

**Guiding Questions:**

1. Compare and contrast: What core preservation goals does GitHub Archive Program share with Software Heritage, and what fundamental differences can you identify in their preservation methodologies?
2. Environmental considerations: What specific properties of the Arctic location make it suitable for the Code Vault, and how does this physical storage strategy reflect GitHub's thinking about different preservation timescales?

**Critical Analysis Questions:**

1. Preservation philosophy: How does the Internet Archive's approach to software preservation fundamentally differ from both Software Heritage and GitHub Archive Program in terms of what aspects of software history it prioritizes?
2. Historical significance: Browse the main categories visible on the Collection homepage and identify distinct types of software preserved there. Evaluate why preserving this diversity of software types—from early computer programs to web-based applications—contributes to our understanding of technological and cultural evolution.

**Comparative reflection:** How do these three approaches—comprehensive source code archiving, secure long-term storage, and executable preservation—address different aspects of code as heritage? Which aspects might still be missing from current preservation efforts?

## Conclusion

This lesson has introduced you to source code as a distinctive form of born-digital heritage—one that demands adapted methods of historical analysis while offering unique insights into our digital age.

**Heritage recognition.** Source code has gained official recognition as cultural heritage, but this recognition comes with awareness of its fragility and the active effort required to preserve it. Unlike monuments or manuscripts, code faces threats from technological obsolescence, platform changes, and the ephemeral nature of digital storage. Preservation requires not passive storage but continuous, intentional intervention.

**Interpretive methods.** Reading code as a historian requires adapting traditional source criticism for born-digital materials. The layered reading approach we developed—attending simultaneously to code as technical object, textual artifact, historical trace, and archival construction—offers a framework for this work. As our case studies demonstrated, the boundaries between "external" and "internal" criticism become productively blurred in digital sources: the artifact often documents its own history, embedding provenance information within itself. This is not a failure of method but a characteristic of digital heritage that historians must learn to navigate.

The Apollo case study illustrated how code becomes heritage through a chain of decisions and transformations: from working software to archived printouts to digitized images to transcribed files to online repositories. Each stage shapes what we can know about the original artifact. The journey also revealed what code alone cannot tell us—the gender dynamics, institutional contexts, and invisible labor that require sources beyond the code itself to recover.

**Preservation infrastructure.** Major initiatives like Software Heritage, the GitHub Archive Program, and the Internet Archive Software Collection address different dimensions of code preservation from different institutional positions. Software Heritage, rooted in academic values, prioritizes comprehensive collection and scholarly citation. GitHub's corporate initiative emphasizes longevity and redundancy through dramatic physical storage. The Internet Archive, embodying early internet idealism, focuses on preserving the experiential dimension—how software actually worked and felt to use. No single approach captures everything; together, they work toward a more complete record of our digital heritage.

**Looking forward.** The methods and resources introduced in this lesson open possibilities for research across multiple fields: history of technology, intellectual history, cultural studies, science and technology studies. As more code becomes accessible through preservation initiatives, and as tools for analyzing large codebases improve, the potential for historical research will only grow.

Throughout, we have emphasized that code is never merely technical. It embeds assumptions, reflects power structures, and bears the marks of its creators' cultures and contexts. Approaching code critically means attending to what is present and what is absent, who is credited and who is overlooked, what is preserved and what is lost. This critical stance—borrowed from traditional source criticism but adapted for digital materials—is what distinguishes historical analysis of code from technical documentation.

You are now equipped to begin exploring code as heritage: to read it not just for what it does, but for what it reveals about the humans who created it and the world in which they worked.
