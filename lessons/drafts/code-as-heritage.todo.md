# Todo List - Code as Heritage (v2)

## 📋 How to Use This Todo List

**Organization:**
- Sections appear in order from Section 1 through Conclusion (matching lesson structure)
- Within each section: Incomplete tasks `[ ]` appear first, completed tasks `[x]` appear at the end
- **When adding new tasks:** Always add them to the appropriate existing section (don't create new section headers)

**Priority System (for task selection):**
1. **HIGHEST:** General Tasks (comprehensive reviews across entire lesson)
2. **HIGH:** Sections 2.c, 2.d, Section 3, and Conclusion (high-impact content requiring refinement)
3. **MEDIUM:** Remaining tasks in Sections 1 and 2.a (secondary improvements)
4. **LOWER:** General polish (image legends, phrasing, scaffolding review)

## 🎯 General Tasks - Lesson-wide Comprehensive Review

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING - All sections require these reviews before finalization

- [ ] **Verify all section and subsection titles for clarity, consistency, and pedagogical progression across entire lesson**

- [ ] **Update timing estimates for all sections to reflect actual content and pacing:**
  - [ ] Adjust Section 1.a, 1.b, 1.c time allocations
  - [ ] Adjust Section 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 2.d time allocations
  - [ ] Adjust Section 3.a, 3.b time allocations
  - [ ] Calculate total lesson time based on revised estimates

- [ ] **Verify all Reading/viewing suggestions sections for link accessibility, citation consistency, and resource balance across entire lesson**

---

## 🔧 Lower Priority Polish

- [ ] Check for excessive use of "let's explore" in the text and replace with varied transitions
- [ ] Rewrite image legends for consistency and clarity across all figures
- [ ] Review pedagogical scaffolding across all exercises

## 📚 Additional Resources (for integration)

### FORTRAN Historical Sources

**Archive:** https://softwarepreservation.computerhistory.org/FORTRAN/

**Recommended citations:**
- J.W. Backus et al. "The FORTRAN Automatic Coding System." Proceedings Western Joint Computer Conference, 1957.
- John W. Backus. "The history of FORTRAN I, II and III." Proceedings First ACM SIGPLAN Conference on History of Programming Languages, 1978.
- Mark Halpern. "On the Heels of the Pioneers." Annals of the History of Computing, 1991.

**Why it matters:** FORTRAN (high-level abstraction) vs. AGC assembly (bare-metal control) illuminates philosophical choices embedded in code.
