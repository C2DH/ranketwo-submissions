# Todo List - Code as Heritage (v2)

## General Issues (Lesson-wide)

- [ ] Check for excessive use of "let's explore" in the text and replace with varied transitions
- [ ] Rewrite image legends for consistency and clarity across all figures
- [ ] Review pedagogical scaffolding across all exercises

---

## Section 1: Understanding Digital Heritage Recognition

**Status:** 🚧 PENDING APOLLO 11 EXPANSION

- [x] Learning objectives added
- [x] All subsections (1.a, 1.b, 1.c) developed with content and exercises
- [x] Reading/viewing suggestions added
- [x] Figure captions and credits complete

- [ ] **NEW:** Contextualize Apollo 11 more thoroughly in Section 1.c:
  - [ ] Add more detailed timeline of Apollo 11 software development (1965-1969)
  - [ ] Explain the significance of 36,000 lines of assembly code for 1969 computing standards
  - [ ] Add paragraph on Apollo 11 as urgent preservation case study

*Section 1 will be ready for publication after Apollo 11 expansion.*

---

## Section 2: Learning to Read Code as Cultural Text

**Status:** 🚧 Multiple drafts requiring rework

- [x] Learning objectives added

### Section 2.a: Source Criticism in the Digital Age

**Status:** 🟡 NEARLY COMPLETE - Pending minor refinements

- [x] **COMPLETED:** Rethink how source criticism is introduced
  - [x] The lesson no longer introduces external/internal criticism distinction as a framework that "collapses"
  - [x] Instead, it establishes that traditional source criticism *questions* apply to code: "Who created this? When? For what purpose? Has it been altered? Can we trust it? How did it reach us?"
  - [x] The "Specificities of Code as Historical Evidence" section addresses what makes digital sources unique without claiming traditional methods don't work
  - [x] The "Approaching Code: Key Analytical Questions" section presents nine analytical dimensions as a flexible toolkit, not a rigid methodology
  - [x] Resolution: The lesson adapts source criticism practices for digital sources rather than abandoning them

- [ ] **Remove all references to "layered method/layered reading"** - Locations to check:
  - Section 2.a: No explicit "layered reading" framework language found - the nine analytical questions are presented as concurrent concerns, not layers ✅
  - Section 2.b GW-BASIC exercise: Uses phrase "Apply the layered reading approach" - **NEEDS REVISION**
  - Section 2.c Apollo case study: Uses phrase "Apply the layered reading approach" - **NEEDS REVISION**
  - Conclusion: References "The layered reading approach we developed" - **NEEDS REVISION**

- [x] **COMPLETED:** Address the question of authenticity more thoroughly:
  - [x] "Establishing Provenance and Authenticity" subsection fully developed with detailed discussion of:
    - [x] Digital code duplication challenges
    - [x] Unauthorized leaks (Twitter 2023 example)
    - [x] Authenticity vs. completeness questions
  - [x] No section on "detecting unauthorized modifications" explicitly, but covered through Twitter leak example and discussion of code reaching us "through paths its creators never intended"
  - [x] Framework for transcription fidelity integrated into "Reborn Digital Heritage" subsection
  - [x] Multiple versions comparison addressed in "Multiple Temporalities" section
  - [x] Platform-specific alterations addressed in "Dependency on Technical Infrastructure" subsection

- [ ] **Expand English language dominance discussion in "Linguistic and Cultural Markers" subsection:**
  - [x] Historical context: "reflects the dominance of English-speaking countries in early computing history"
  - [x] Barrier identification: "creating barriers for non-native English speakers"
  - [ ] **TODO:** Case studies of alternatives (Chinese Smalltalk, Ruby Japanese documentation) - **NOT YET ADDED**
  - [ ] **TODO:** Research citations on non-native English speaker barriers (Robins 2010) - **NOT YET ADDED**
  - [ ] **TODO:** Expansion of linguistic imperialism discussion - **PARTIALLY DONE** (mentions dominance, needs deepening)
  - [ ] **TODO:** Links to non-English programming initiatives - **NOT YET ADDED**

- [x] **RESOLVED:** "The Entanglement Problem" - This subsection does not appear in current draft (outdated todo item)
  - The draft presents "Specificities of Code as Historical Evidence" which addresses self-documenting artifacts and interdependencies
  - This replaces the theoretical "Entanglement Problem" discussion

### Section 2.b: Programming Languages as Historical Markers

- [ ] **Enhance Rosetta Code exercise** - Current version still lacks concrete side-by-side code examples:
  - [ ] Add 2-3 actual code examples (FORTRAN, C, Python side-by-side)
  - [ ] Include specific analytical questions (verbosity, syntax, memory constraints)
  - [ ] Add expected observations for instructors
  - [ ] Clarify what students should conclude about historical context shaping language design

**Resource:** [Rosetta Code Hello World](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Text) - 300+ programming languages, organized chronologically

- [ ] **Revise GW-BASIC Case Study (Section 2.b):**
  - [x] Add note that the exact source code snippet location may vary
  - [x] Add web research component to exercise (incentivize students to find the source)
  - [x] Convert to detective work exercise (locating authentic versions)
  - [x] Add guidance on verifying authenticity of found sources
  - [x] Provide tips on evaluating different repository versions
  - [x] Add incentive language emphasizing value of source-finding skills
  - [ ] **REMOVE:** Exercise still uses phrase "Apply the layered reading approach" - **NEEDS REVISION** to remove "layered reading" language

### Section 2.c: The Journey of the Apollo Code

- [ ] **Remove "layered reading" language from Apollo 11 code analysis:**
  - [ ] GW-BASIC Case Study exercise: Replace "Apply the layered reading approach:" with instructions for applying analytical questions
  - [ ] Apollo 11 section: Replace "Let us now apply the layered reading approach to a specific code artifact" with language about examining the code through analytical dimensions

- [ ] **Rethink the Margaret Hamilton case** - Current "The Human Context" subsection needs:
  - Deeper engagement with gender dynamics in computing history
  - Better integration with code analysis (not just a separate subsection)
  - More primary sources and scholarly framing
  - Clearer pedagogical purpose

- [ ] **Refine the Apollo 11 code reconstruction narrative** - Needs:
  - Stronger connection to preservation/heritagization themes
  - More nuanced discussion of what was lost vs. recovered
  - Better scaffolding for student analysis

- [ ] **Strengthen BURN_BABY_BURN analysis** - Needs:
  - Deeper cultural/historical context
  - Clearer analytical framework application
  - More rigorous exercise design

**Reference integrated:** [BURN_BABY_BURN--MASTER_IGNITION_ROUTINE.agc](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11/blob/master/Luminary099/BURN_BABY_BURN--MASTER_IGNITION_ROUTINE.agc) ✅

**KTH humor research integrated:** [Humor in Software Development](https://www.kth.se/en/eecs/nyheter/humor-en-viktig-ingrediens-i-mjukvaruutveckling-1.1351788) ✅

### Section 2.d: Esoteric Languages

**Status:** ✅ Added in v2

---

## Section 3: Preserving Code: Initiatives and Infrastructures

**Status:** 🚧 Needs accessibility fix and reading suggestions

- [x] Learning objectives added
- [x] Preservation initiatives expanded

- [ ] **French-language source accessibility issue** - Section 3.a references Schafer 2017 (Bulletin 1024) which is not accessible to English-speaking students:
  - Find equivalent English-language resources about Software Heritage's founding vision
  - Add English summaries or translations of key points
  - Ensure all primary sources for student exercises are available in English
  
  *Current status:* Inline note acknowledges the issue but doesn't resolve it.

- [ ] **Add Reading/viewing suggestions** - Section 3 has no reading suggestions section unlike Sections 1 and 2

---

## Conclusion

**Status:** ⚠️ UNREVIEWED AI DRAFT

- [ ] **Full review and revision required:**
  - Human review for accuracy and appropriateness
  - Verification that it accurately reflects lesson content
  - Revision for tone and style consistency
  - Possible restructuring based on final lesson content

## Additional Resources (for integration)

### FORTRAN Historical Sources

**Archive:** https://softwarepreservation.computerhistory.org/FORTRAN/

**Recommended citations:**
- J.W. Backus et al. "The FORTRAN Automatic Coding System." Proceedings Western Joint Computer Conference, 1957.
- John W. Backus. "The history of FORTRAN I, II and III." Proceedings First ACM SIGPLAN Conference on History of Programming Languages, 1978.
- Mark Halpern. "On the Heels of the Pioneers." Annals of the History of Computing, 1991.

**Why it matters:** FORTRAN (high-level abstraction) vs. AGC assembly (bare-metal control) illuminates philosophical choices embedded in code.
