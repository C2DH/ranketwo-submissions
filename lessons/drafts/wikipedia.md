## Introduction 

The purpose of this lesson is to teach historians how they can use Wikipedia as a source for historical research. Wikipedia constitutes a digital resource of historical knowledge with its own infrastructure, technology, policies, and guidelines. This lesson aims to familiarize historians with the production of (historical) knowledge on Wikipedia, which in turn will allow them to use Wikipedia to answer their own research questions. 

The lesson focuses on the main content of Wikipedia but it also looks “behind the scenes,” at the discussions and debates between Wikipedia users. The online discussions include stimulating information about how Wikipedia users perceive the past (memories, emotions, personal connections), engage with history, and try to transform the past into Wikipedia articles. At the same time, the discussions reveal how Wikipedia users try to comply with the guidelines and rules of Wikipedia and how they get involved in debates about how history should be represented in the main article. By examining Wikipedia’s infrastructure and content, the lesson invites participants to experiment with digital source criticism and think about potential uses of Wikipedia in historical inquiries. 
 
Specifically, the lesson includes a series of assignments that explore different aspects of historical knowledge production on Wikipedia. The first part investigates the historical value of Wikipedia and invites participants to think about how they can use Wikipedia for historical research and what historical questions they can answer. The second part guides participants through the system of Wikipedia consisting of multiple guidelines and rules that shape the production of history on Wikipedia. The third one allows participants to investigate the main content of Wikipedia articles related to history and the fourth one asks participants to dive into the discussions and debates that take place behind the creation of a Wikipedia page. The final part focuses on two different language editions of Wikipedia, the English and the French language Wikipedia, and asks participants to detect similarities and differences in how a historical event is presented and displayed across different language editions.



## Assignment 1 - Wikipedia and Historians

### 1.a Background information on Wikipedia
In 2000, the US entrepreneur, Jimmy Wales, wanted to create an online encyclopedia similar to past encyclopedias like the Encyclopedia Britannica, in which knowledge production would be based on a system of review by experts in every field. Wales created Nupedia which went online in September 2000 (Salor 2012). However, Wales realized soon that the process of creating and editing articles in Nupedia demanded a lot of time, as the topic had to be studied professionally, so every article had to be sent to experts for review. During the first months of Nupedia, from September 2000 to the end of 2000, there were only twenty-one articles online (Rosenzweig 2011). After the creation of Nupedia, Jimmy Wales, and his colleagues became aware of the success of open-source software, so they decided to change the structure and the model of Nupedia and to create an encyclopedia based on the tools of sharing and openness. In January 2001, Jimmy Wales learned about a website, called WikiWikiWeb, which “allowed anyone to edit any page at any time,” while no special software was needed and no log-in or password was required, and the changes on a page were saved immediately (Lih 2009). The WikiWikiWeb software was developed by the programmer Ward Cunningham in the 1990s, which allowed anyone to create and edit a Web page (Rosenzweig 2009). 

By mid-January 2001, Wales and his colleagues had followed that model and changed the encyclopedia’s name to Wikipedia. From a free and online encyclopedia of experts, Wikipedia transformed into an encyclopedia, in which “anyone could edit any page at any time” (Lih 2009). Soon, Wikipedia managed to surpass Nupedia and create a new community of people, who actively engage with its contents. In late January, Wikipedia had managed to have seventeen articles, in late February it had 150 articles, in March 572, in April 835, in May 1,300, in June 1,700, in July 2,400, and in August, 3,700. At the end of 2001, Wikipedia had 15,000 articles and 350 Wikipedia editors  (Poe 2006).

To better understand how and why Wikipedia was created and what new characteristics it brought in terms of knowledge production, please watch the YouTube video below, in which you will find a presentation of Wikipedia by its founder, Jimmy Wales, from 2007.

> "Jimmy Wales: how a ragtag band created Wikipedia." YouTube Video. 20:48 minutes 

https://youtu.be/WQR0gx0QBZ4

Once you have watched the YouTube video, try to answer the following questions:
- How and why <!--more precisions have to be added here on what is wanted from the audience to find--> has Wikipedia managed to become a self-regulated community consisting of millions of users, who constantly create and update its content? 
- Which characteristics of Wikipedia as presented in the video did you as historians find most interesting? 
- How do those characteristics affect historical knowledge production in the digital age? 

### 1.b Why should historians be interested in Wikipedia? 
In 2021, the American Historical Association published [a study on how the American public perceives and understands the past](https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/september-2021/a-snapshot-of-the-publics-views-on-history-national-poll-offers-valuable-insights-for-historians-and-advocates). The study was based on a national survey of 1,816 people and signified the most current overview of the public’s view on history. According to AHA’s study, 46% of respondents turn to Wikipedia to learn about history and acquire a historical understanding of the past. Wikipedia was ranked higher than other historical activities, such as “Historic site visit,” “Museum visit,” “Genealogy work,” “Social media,” “Podcast/radio program,” “History lecture,” and “History-related video game.” Almost half of the respondents argued that they use Wikipedia as a source of historical knowledge. These findings combined with the current appropriation of Wikipedia’s corpus by [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) and Wikipedia’s partnership with the most central search engine in the digital world, Google, and other digital assistants, such as [Siri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri) and [Alexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa), make clear how crucial the role of Wikipedia is in how the public learns about history and makes sense of the past away front traditional academic and publishing venues. 

Based on your personal experience with Wikipedia, please try to answer the following questions: 
- How have you used Wikipedia so far?  
- Have you ever used Wikipedia to answer historical questions? Did you manage to answer them?  
- How can historians use Wikipedia? 
- Can historians use Wikipedia for historical research? If yes, what historical questions can they answer?

### 1.c Wikipedia as a source of historical knowledge
Since the emergence of Wikipedia in 2001, several researchers have started examining the online encyclopedia. They studied Wikipedia from different perspectives, ranging from the accuracy of Wikipedia and how Wikipedia works to more recent works on how Wikipedia can become diverse and inclusive and the datafication of its content. However, most of those studies were written by scholars in media and communication studies, and information science. Historians were absent from this type of research. Any explanations why? As this lesson will show, Wikipedia constitutes a valuable resource of historical knowledge. Being familiar with how history is constructed on Wikipedia means that historians will be able to take advantage of the opportunities that Wikipedia’s content and data offer. Historians can use Wikipedia as a historical source to better understand what stories about the past Wikipedia articles tell, how these stories are shaped, discussed, and produced in the digital age, and by whom. By doing that, historians will be able to discern what Wikipedia articles reveal about history-making in the digital age, and, therefore, they will open up new inquiries and approaches to historical research. 

The assignments below allow historians to experiment with multiple potential uses of Wikipedia as a source of historical knowledge through the lenses of digital source criticism. Wikipedia articles constitute born-digital sources published on the web, to which historians can ask questions related to digital source criticism, e.g., how are Wikipedia articles related to history created and by whom? How do Wikipedia articles change over time? how do Wikipedia editors discuss a historical topic while they update or create a Wikipedia article? What historical questions can historians answer by using Wikipedia articles?

## Assignment 2 - Exploring Wikipedia’s Infrastructure

Since its foundation, Wikipedia has managed to become a self-regulated community and a public space where people can discuss, create, and edit historical articles. The digital structure of Wikipedia including its policies, guidelines, hierarchy, and sub-communities encourages dynamic participation in Wikipedia and an active engagement with the production of historical knowledge. At the same time, Wikipedia creates a multilayered system of bureaucracy and surveillance that does not allow all users to have the same power within the Wikipedia community and, thus, determine the production of historical knowledge in the same way. In the subsections below, we will investigate Wikipedia’s infrastructure by going over the policies and guidelines of Wikipedia, the “talk pages” where Wikipedians take part in discussions and debates about history, the editing changes of Wikipedia articles, and finally, the perception of History, as a field of knowledge, by Wikipedia

### 2.a General policies and guidelines
To explore the opportunities that Wikipedia offers for historical research, we should first understand how Wikipedia works. Even though Wikipedia promotes the idea that “anyone can edit nearly any page and improve articles immediately,” it includes a system of rules, policies, and guidelines that determine the production of knowledge and Wikipedia users’ engagement with its contents. Wikipedia as an encyclopedia includes subjects ranging from mathematics and biology to sports, culture, and the arts. Even though all guidelines and policies of Wikipedia are common for all its subjects, there are particular modifications and rules for each subject. This lesson aims to make participants explore the broader system of the Wikipedia community but, at the same time, focus on history as a content subject category of Wikipedia. In that way, participants will identify the guidelines that Wikipedia has established for the collection and dissemination of historical knowledge and understand how Wikipedia manages to motivate its users to create or edit Wikipedia pages.

Please visit the following Wikipedia pages that contain specific information on Wikipedia’s policies, guidelines, and rules, which determine how knowledge is produced on Wikipedia and how users can engage with its contents. 

- You can first check [the three core principles that sum up Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Trifecta). These will give you a quick view of the main principles of Wikipedia. 
- For a more detailed view, you can then check the so-called [five pillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars), alias the more detailed principles that form the basis of the editorial policy of Wikipedia. 
- If you wish to go further, you can also read the [statement of principles from Wikipedia founder Jimbo Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jimbo_Wales/Statement_of_principles) - however, this reading is not necessary to do the exercise.

Now, try to answer the following question: what are the most important principles and policies of Wikipedia? 

The principles you just examined provide the basis for a set of specific instructions that guide the authors of Wikipedia to develop content: these are the Wikipedia guidelines. 
- Check the general framework of the [policies for developing content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines#%C2%ADContent) 
- Read the [guidelines of Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines).

Then answer the following questions:

- Which policies encourage Wikipedia users to engage with its content?
- Why does this system of rules, policies, and guidelines not prevent users from editing and instead it motivates them to create or update more and more Wikipedia articles? 

Finally, read the detailed [explanations for sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources). Wikipedia creators attach great importance to information reliability and content quality.  


Now, after also reflecting on your previous readings - or discussing with your class comrades, if you have the possibility - try to answer the following question: 

- How do the policies and guidelines of Wikipedia shape the production of historical knowledge on Wikipedia? 


### 2.b Talk pages and revision history 
Besides the policies and guidelines that define knowledge production on Wikipedia, every Wikipedia article has two portals, the “talk page” or discussion page and the “view history” portal. You can access these from the main menu that you see under the title of the article. 

![How to access "talk" and "view history" pages of a Wikipedia article](/assets/images/wikipedia/wp-talk-viewhistory.jpg "How to access talk and view history pages of a Wikipedia article")

In the “talk page,” users can find all the archived discussions about all the edits that the given entry suffered through time. The “talk” area also shows all the discussions and debates between Wikipedia users about the entries. The users often question statements cited on the Wikipedia page expressing their disagreements and suggestions for the page. Other users then correspond, and the “talk” page becomes a discussion page. The “view history” page includes the logs of all the changes (without the discussion) and copies of older versions of the articles. This kind of information can help historians apply the basic principles of traditional internal source criticism to identify how a source was created and by whom. 

In the two links below, you will find more information provided by Wikipedia on the “talk pages” and “view history,” please read the content of the two articles: 

[“Talk pages”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Talk_pages) - alternatively, you can watch a two minutes video provided on the page.  

[“View history”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Page_history) - alternatively, you can watch a nine-minute video provided on the page. 

Then, try to answer the following questions:

- How can “talk pages” and “view history” portals of Wikipedia articles be useful for historians?
- What historical questions can the data from “talk pages” and “view history” answer?

<!-- If 2B is realized with viewing the videos rather than reading the lengthy pages for talk and history, then 30 minutes are sufficient to execute this part of the lesson -->

### 2.c History on Wikipedia
As Wikipedia covers multiple subjects, it has created separate portals for each subject it covers. In these portals, there are definitions of the subject and further information on the different subfields and categories of the subject. Apart from its general guidelines and policies, Wikipedia has also established more specific instructions about the coverage of each subject. History constitutes one of Wikipedia's subjects, and, therefore, it has its own portal and is subject to specific rules of writing. For example, Wikipedia specifies the types of sources that Wikipedia editors are allowed to use for the coverage of historical topics.

To learn more about the subject of history on Wikipedia, please go to the [homepage of the portal dedicated to history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:History) and explore the following aspects: 
- the definition of history the page provides 
- the ways you can access the contents via this page (featured articles and pictures, commemorations, quotes, categories, etc.)
- the lists of associated elements

Now, try to answer the following questions:

- How does Wikipedia seem to perceive history? 
- In what ways is this perception similar or different from definitions provided by [academic historians](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/head-head/what-history) or by a [large public audience](https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/history-the-past-and-public-culture-results-from-a-national-survey/1-how-does-the-public-define-history)?
- Based on your personal experience, how do you navigate Wikipedia's content? How do you find a Wikipedia article that you are looking for?

### 2.d Sources of History according to Wikipedia
To conduct historical research, historians use sources from the past. They use primary sources, which include materials created during a historical period, e.g., written archives, audiovisual archives, oral interviews, objects, etc., and reveal information about the society, culture, economy, politics, and technology of the past. Historians also use secondary sources, e.g. books and articles, which place primary sources into the broader historical context of the period. By combining primary with secondary sources, historians write a story about the past.

Please read the [page specifying the sources that editors are allowed to use when they write about history on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_source_examples#History).

Then, try to answer the following questions:

- What sources can Wikipedia editors use to create or edit pages related to history? 
- Are the sources that Wikipedia recommends different from the sources that academic historians use?

## Assignment 3 - Writing on Wikipedia: Structure and Historical Narrative

Wikipedia articles include historical narratives about the past. In other words, Wikipedia articles tell a story about the past. The stories are the result of collaborative writing between Wikipedia users and each article has a different structure, e.g., (chapters, sections, infoboxes, hyperlinks), includes different visual and audio elements, (e.g., graphs, videos, images, sounds), and bibliographical references. As you have a better understanding of how Wikipedia works and its main policies and guidelines for the production of historical knowledge, let’s look at the historical narrative of a Wikipedia article. First, read the [September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks), and, while you read it, please pay attention to the following elements: 

- how the historical narrative of the Wikipedia article is structured and how it differs from traditional historical narratives. 

- the visual and audio materials that are part of the article's narrative.

- the bibliography that the editors have used, the hyperlinks, and the references to other historical events. 

Then, think critically and try to answer the following questions:

- How have Wikipedia users organized the historical narrative of the Wikipedia article?
- What kind of visual and audio materials (e.g., graphs, videos, images, sounds, etc.) does the Wikipedia article include? How do those materials affect the historical narrative of the article?
- How do hyperlinks work and how do they affect the way a potential user reads and understands the article?
- How would you characterize the types of works that Wikipedia users cite in the article? Do they use academic works, journalistic, or any other types? Are the cited works available online?
- Do you detect any similarities or differences with the way traditional historians organize their historical narratives in academic books or articles?


## Assignment 4 - Behind the Scenes of Wikipedia Articles

Many people visit Wikipedia to learn about history. However, few of them probably know that Wikipedia articles are products of long debates, conflicts, collaborations, discussions, and consensus between different Wikipedia editors. Wikipedia provides us the opportunity to look “behind the scenes” and explore how Wikipedia articles take shape and change over time. The “talk page” and “view history” portals of Wikipedia reveal the discussions between users on each entry and the logs of all the changes and copies of older versions of the article. Both portals include significant data for historical research. As Wikipedia users get involved with the creation and editing of articles, they participate in discussions and debates, which provide useful data about how Wikipedians perceive the past, what historical arguments they make, how they try to reach a consensus, etc. In the "view history" portal, there is also data on how the historical narrative of a Wikipedia article changes over time. In this part of the lesson, we will investigate what happens “behind the scenes” of a Wikipedia article by unveiling both the discussions between the users and the editing history of an article. To do that, we will focus on one case study, the [Wikipedia page of the September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks).

### 4.a Historical discussions and debates
The September 11 attacks constitute a traumatic event that shaped modern United States history but also had a broader global impact. If you click on the article's " talk page, " you will notice that the discussions are extensive. However, I have collected some examples, which reveal information on how Wikipedia users perceive the past and get involved in debates with other users on how to edit a Wikipedia article. Specifically, the examples below include different types of information, such as how Wikipedians should honor the memory of the victims, how they should describe the people who caused the attacks, what title they should place into the Wikipedia article, etc. So, please click on the links below and read only the sections mentioned in the titles. For more information on "talk pages" and how to use them, see the video in assignment 2.b.

- [Talk on the title of the article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_3#Article_Title) 
- [Talk on deleting the word terrorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_7#Deleting_terrorist) 
- [Talk on the use of terms, "terrorist", "terrorism," and "freedom fighter"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_11#%22Terrorist%22,_%22terrorism%22_and_%22freedom_fighter%22) 
- [Talk on memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_13#In_Memorium) 
- [Talk on memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_21#Memorial) 

Then, try to answer the following questions:

- Which topics related to the September 11 attacks do most Wikipedia users discuss?
- Why do Wikipedia users get involved in debates?
- What arguments do they make to support their opinions, and what reactions do they receive from other Wikipedians in the specific case studies?
- How do Wikipedia users perceive the September 11 attacks? Do they express any personal emotions and memories about the past of the September 11 attacks?
- Why do Wikipedians want to edit the September 11 attacks Wikipedia page? What is the meaning of editing for them?
- How do Wikipedia users involved in discussions and debates try to reach a consensus?

### 4.b Historical articles in constant motion
Historical narratives are not stable; instead, they change over time. Now let’s see how the Wikipedia article of the September 11 attacks has changed since its creation. The links below refer to two pages with the most recent revisions of the article. Please click on the two links below, which contain the most recent editing changes to the article and the editors who made those changes. While you read the pages, please pay attention to: 

1. the type of editing changes, e.g., correcting vocabulary and grammar mistakes, adding more visual materials, reorganizing the text of the article, etc. 
2. the editors who make those changes.

For more information on how to use the "view history" portal, please watch the video in assignment 2.b. 

[Revision history page 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=September_11_attacks&action=history&dir=prev&offset=20231126232142%7C1187018579) 

[Revision history page 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=September_11_attacks&action=history&offset=20231127221517%7C1187170755) 

Even though our sample is small (only two pages from a very extensive revision history), please try to answer the following questions:

- How does the historical narrative of the article change over time?
- What type of contributions do editors make?
- By looking at the names of editors, do you notice the existence of bots? What does the collaboration between humans and non-human agents signify for the production of history in the digital age?

## Assignment 5 - Comparing Wikipedias in different languages 

Wikipedia does not exist only in the English language. Instead, it includes 339 language editions as of December 2023. The different editions are not just simple translations from one language to another but constitute different historical narratives about the past with different representations, structures, and discussions. Wikipedia's multilingual character allows historians to compare historical narratives across different languages.  In this part, we will compare two different Wikipedia language editions, the English language Wikipedia and the French one. Specifically, we will focus on a specific historical event, May 1968, as it is represented in the English and French Wikipedia. Even though the English language Wikipedia contains the most active registered users and covers more articles than other editions, May 1968 constitutes a major event in French history, which also affected a broader non-French audience. The participants of this course will investigate if the interface of Wikipedia encourages a specific way of presenting and displaying across different language editions by comparing the historical narratives of the two articles.
 
First, read the historical narratives of the following two articles:

[May 1968, in English language Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_68#:~:text=Beginning%20in%20May%201968%2C%20a,France%20came%20to%20a%20halt)

[May 1968, in French language Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mai_68)
 
After reading both articles, you will notice that apart from some obvious historical details that both historical narratives include, the representation of May 1968 is not the same. The two articles have different structures, sections, and sub-sections, different visual details, use different bibliographical references, etc. 

Now, please try to answer the following questions:

- What are the main similarities and differences in how the two Wikipedia articles present the May 1968 historical events? How do you explain these similarities/differences?
- Which article does it cover May 1968 “better” (extensive analysis, more textual and visual details, etc.) and why?
- Do you detect any similarities or differences in the bibliography that the two articles cite?
- Based on these two case studies, does Wikipedia promote a specific way of presenting and displaying a historical event across the two Wikipedia editions? Does the location of a historical event mean more extensive coverage or more user engagement in the related language Wikipedia?
