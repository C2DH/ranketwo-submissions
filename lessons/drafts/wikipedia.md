## Introduction 

The purpose of this lesson is to teach historians how they can use Wikipedia as a source for historical research. Wikipedia constitutes a digital resource of historical knowledge with its own infrastructure, technology, policies, and guidelines. This lesson aims to familiarize historians with the production of (historical) knowledge on Wikipedia, which in turn will allow them to use Wikipedia to answer their own research questions. 

The lesson focuses on the main content of Wikipedia but it also looks “behind the scenes,” at the discussions and debates between Wikipedia users. The online discussions include stimulating information about how Wikipedia users perceive the past (memories, emotions, personal connections), engage with history, and try to transform the past into Wikipedia articles. At the same time, the discussions reveal how Wikipedia users try to comply with the guidelines and rules of Wikipedia and how they get involved in debates about how history should be represented in the main article. By examining Wikipedia’s infrastructure and content, the lesson invites participants to experiment with digital source criticism and think about potential uses of Wikipedia in historical inquiries. 
 
Specifically, the lesson includes a series of assignments that explore different aspects of historical knowledge production on Wikipedia. The first part investigates the historical value of Wikipedia and invites participants to think about how they can use Wikipedia for historical research and what historical questions they can answer. The second part guides participants through the system of Wikipedia consisting of multiple guidelines and rules that shape the production of history on Wikipedia. The third one allows participants to investigate the main content of Wikipedia articles related to history and the fourth one asks participants to dive into the discussions and debates that take place behind the creation of a Wikipedia page. The final part focuses on two different language editions of Wikipedia, the English and the French language Wikipedia, and asks participants to detect similarities and differences in how a historical event is presented and displayed across different language editions.



## Assignment 1 - Why should historians be interested in Wikipedia? 

The appearance of Wikipedia in 2001 caused discussions and debates among historians and scholars in the humanities and social sciences. For some scholars, Wikipedia brought a novel, web-based and crowdsourced model of historical knowledge production beyond the traditional academic historical writing based on research expertise and peer-review. Those scholars saw Wikipedia as an intellectual opportunity to redefine historical writing and adapt it to the needs and challenges of the digital age. Other scholars criticized Wikipedia for including low-quality and superficial information written by people without any scientific expertise, exploiting free labor to keep its content alive, having gender and race-related disparities in terms of community members and thematic coverage. In spite of these debates, historians seem, or ought to, embrace the use of Wikipedia in their research and teaching. This assignment proposes to consider Wikipedia in a historical perspective and introduce to its importance for historians.    

### 1.a Background information on Wikipedia | 45 min
In 2000, the United States based entrepreneur, [Jimmy Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales), wanted to create an online [encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia) similar to past encyclopedias like the [Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/), in which knowledge production would be based on a system of review by experts in every field. Wales created [Nupedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nupedia) which went online in September 2000 (Salor 2012). However, Wales realized soon that the process of creating and editing articles in Nupedia demanded a lot of time, as the topic had to be studied professionally and sent to experts for review. At the same time, Jimmy Wales and his colleagues became aware of the success of open-source software that allowed collaborative work, so they decided to change the structure and the model of Nupedia and to create an encyclopedia based on the tools of sharing and openness. They turned to the [WikiWikiWeb](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWikiWeb) software developed by the programmer Ward Cunningham in the 1990s, which allowed anyone to create, edit, and instantly save a Web page (Rosenzweig 2009; Lih 2009). The software also allowed collaborative editing. By mid-January 2001, Wales and his colleagues had followed that model and changed the encyclopedia’s name to Wikipedia. From a free and online encyclopedia of experts, Wikipedia transformed into an encyclopedia, in which “anyone could edit any page at any time” (Lih 2009). Soon, Wikipedia managed to create a new community of people, who actively engage with its contents. At the end of 2001, Wikipedia had 15,000 articles and 350 editors (Poe 2006).

To explore how a new encyclopedia model was born in the Internet era, please watch the following YouTube video: 

> Justin Franco. “The History of Wikipedia (in two minutes).” YouTube Video, 02:47 minutes. 3 December 2009, [https://youtu.be/oVFPW0r4jWk](https://youtu.be/oVFPW0r4jWk). 

To better understand how and why Wikipedia was created and what new characteristics it brought in terms of knowledge production, please watch the YouTube video below, in which you will find a presentation of Wikipedia by its founder, Jimmy Wales, from 2007.

> "Jimmy Wales: how a ragtag band created Wikipedia." YouTube Video. 20:48 minutes [https://youtu.be/WQR0gx0QBZ4](https://youtu.be/WQR0gx0QBZ4).
 

Once you have watched the videos, try to answer the following questions and discuss your answers with your fellow students:
- How do you explain the transition from Nupedia to Wikipedia? Try to find at least three major reasons - hint: think in terms of technology used, economic model, copyright issues, practices of knowledge construction...
- How and why has Wikipedia managed to become a self-regulated community consisting of millions of users, who constantly create and update its content?
- Which characteristics of Wikipedia as presented in the video did you as historians find most interesting?
- How do those characteristics affect historical knowledge production in the digital age?


### 1.b Why does Wikipedia matter for historians? | 25 min 
In 2021, the American Historical Association published [a study on how the American public perceives and understands the past](https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/september-2021/a-snapshot-of-the-publics-views-on-history-national-poll-offers-valuable-insights-for-historians-and-advocates). The study was based on a national survey of 1,816 people and signified the most current overview of the public’s view on history. According to AHA’s study, 46% of respondents turn to Wikipedia to learn about history and acquire a historical understanding of the past. Wikipedia was ranked higher than other historical activities, such as “Historic site visit,” “Museum visit,” “Genealogy work,” “Social media,” “Podcast/radio program,” “History lecture,” and “History-related video game.” Almost half of the respondents argued that they use Wikipedia as a source of historical knowledge. These findings combined with the current appropriation of Wikipedia’s corpus by [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) and Wikipedia’s partnership with the most central search engine in the digital world, Google, and other digital assistants, such as [Siri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri) and [Alexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa), make clear how crucial the role of Wikipedia is in how the public learns about history and makes sense of the past away front traditional academic and publishing venues. 

Based on your personal experience with Wikipedia, please try to answer the questions below. If you are in a class, you can discuss your answers with your fellow students:

- Have you used Wikipedia so far? If yes, try to formulate clearly what kind of use you made, for example: to share your knowledge on a particular topic, to look for an information, to use available data…  
- Have you ever used Wikipedia while working on historical questions? 
  - Why did you choose Wikipedia?
  - Did you manage to answer the questions?
  - Were there particular parts of the article that were more useful than others?
  - Did you check the sources?
  - Did you combine use of Wikipedia with use of other sources of knowledge?
  - Did you encounter mistakes? 


Now watch this video where the US historian [Jim Grossman](https://www.historians.org/person/jim-grossman/) evokes different possible uses of Wikipedia by historians: 

Intelligent Channel. [“Wikipedia, history, and historians - Jim Grossman in INT's ENLIGHTENMENT MINUTES”.](https://youtu.be/S-Yj7V6d54Q) YouTube video. 4:32 min.   

Then, also based on your knowledge about Wikipedia and your personal experiences, try to answer and discuss the following questions:
- In what ways can historians use Wikipedia? 
- Can historians use Wikipedia for historical research? If yes, can you imagine what historical questions can they can answer?

## Assignment 2 - Exploring Wikipedia’s infrastructure and policies 

Wikipedia articles constitute born-digital sources that contain historically stimulating information about how Wikipedia users perceive the past, how they interpret it based on the present, and how they transform the past into Wikipedia articles. These types of historical information can be extracted from the main content of Wikipedia but also from the discussions and debates between Wikipedia users, which take place “behind the scenes,” in the “talk pages” of articles. Thus, historians who work with Wikipeda must be familiar with both the specificities of its infrastructure and the policies governing the (historical) knowledge production in Wikipedia, to be able to contextualize the information they retrieve.  

Since its foundation, Wikipedia has managed to become a self-regulated community and a public space where people can discuss, create, and edit historical articles. The digital structure of Wikipedia including its policies, guidelines, hierarchy, and sub-communities encourages dynamic, albeit multilayered, participation of its editors and an active engagement with the production of historical knowledge. The following subassignments investigate Wikipedia’s infrastructure, policies and guidelines, the “talk pages” where Wikipedians take part in discussions and debates about history, the editing changes of Wikipedia articles, and finally, the perception of History, as a field of knowledge, by Wikipedia.

### 2.a General policies and guidelines | 30 Min
To explore the opportunities that Wikipedia offers for historical research, we should first understand how Wikipedia works. Even though Wikipedia promotes the idea that “anyone can edit nearly any page and improve articles immediately,” it includes a system of rules, policies, and guidelines that determine the production of knowledge and Wikipedia users’ engagement with its contents. As mentioned above, Wikipedia as an encyclopedia includes subjects ranging from mathematics and biology to sports, culture, and the arts. Although all guidelines and policies of Wikipedia are common for all its subjects, there are particular modifications and rules for each subject. This assignment aims to make participants explore the broader system of the Wikipedia community but, at the same time, focus on history as a content subject category of Wikipedia. 

Please visit the following Wikipedia pages that contain specific information on Wikipedia’s policies, guidelines, and rules, which determine how knowledge is produced on Wikipedia. 

- You can first check [the three core principles that sum up Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Trifecta). These will give you a quick view of the main principles that guide editing on Wikipedia. 
- For a more detailed view, you can then check the so-called [five pillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars), alias the more detailed principles that form the basis of the editorial policy of Wikipedia. 
- If you wish to go further, you can also read the [statement of principles from Wikipedia founder Jimbo Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jimbo_Wales/Statement_of_principles) - however, this reading is not necessary for the exercise.

Now, try to answer and discuss the following questions: 
- What are the most important principles and policies of Wikipedia?
- Which policies and guidelines encourage Wikipedia users to engage with its content?
- Why does this system of policies and guidelines not prevent users from editing and instead it motivates them to create or update more and more Wikipedia articles?

As historians do, Wikipedians use sources to create and update Wikipedia articles. Wikipedia provides a comprehensive [summary of what sources Wikipedians can use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources). Please read the introduction and [overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Overview) sections of the article and try to answer the following question:
- What characteristics should the sources that Wikipedians can use have?

### 2.b Talk pages and revision history | 30 to 40 Min 
Besides the policies and guidelines that define knowledge production on Wikipedia, every Wikipedia article page has two tabs, the “talk page” or discussion page and the “view history” tab (fig. 1). You can access these pages from the main menu that you see under the title of the article. 

![How to access "talk" and "view history" pages of a Wikipedia article](/assets/images/wikipedia/wp-talk-viewhistory.jpg "How to access talk and view history pages of a Wikipedia article")

In the “talk page,” users can find all the archived discussions about all the edits that the given entry suffered through time. The “talk” area also shows all the discussions and debates between Wikipedia users about the entries. The users often question statements cited on the Wikipedia page expressing their disagreements and suggestions for the page. Other users then correspond, and the “talk” page becomes a discussion page. The “view history” page includes the logs of all the changes (without the discussion) and copies of older versions of the articles. This kind of information can help historians apply the basic principles of traditional source criticism to identify how a source is created and by whom. 

In the two links below, you will find more information on the “talk pages” and “view history”. Please read the content of the two articles: 

[“Talk pages”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Talk_pages) (estimated time of reading: 10 minutes) - alternatively, you can watch [a two minutes video: "Wikipedia basics - Talk pages"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wikipedia_basics_-_Talk_pages.ogv) provided on the page.  

[“View history”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Page_history) (estimated time of reading: 12 minutes) - alternatively, you can watch [a nine-minute video: "Using the view history tab on Wikipedia"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Using_the_view_history_tab_on_Wikipedia.webm) provided on the page. 

Then, try to answer the following questions:

- How can “talk pages” and “view history” portals of Wikipedia articles be useful for historians?
- What historical questions can the data from “talk pages” and “view history” answer?

<!-- If 2b is realized with viewing the videos rather than reading the lengthy pages for talk and history, then 30 minutes are sufficient to execute this part of the lesson -->

### 2.c History on Wikipedia | 15 Min
As Wikipedia covers multiple subjects, it has created separate portals for each subject it covers. In these portals, there are definitions of the subject and further information on the different subfields and categories of the subject. Apart from its general guidelines and policies,the community of Wikipedia has also established more specific instructions about the coverage of each subject. History constitutes one of Wikipedia's subjects, and, therefore, it has its own portal and is subject to specific rules of writing. For example, Wikipedia specifies the types of sources that Wikipedia editors are allowed to use for the coverage of historical topics.

To learn more about the subject of history on Wikipedia, please go to the [homepage of the portal dedicated to history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:History) and explore the following aspects: 
- the definition of history the page provides 
- the different sections of the page

Now, try to answer the following questions:

- How does Wikipedia seem to perceive history? 
- In what ways is this perception similar or different from definitions provided by academic historians?

If necessary, you can find in the Reading/viewing suggestions section below some resources with various academic definitions of what history is. 


### 2.d Sources of History according to Wikipedia | 40 Min
To conduct historical research, historians use sources from the past. They use primary sources, which include materials created during a historical period, e.g., written archives, audiovisual archives, oral interviews, objects, etc., and reveal information about the society, culture, economy, politics, and technology of the past. Historians also use secondary sources, e.g. books and articles, which place primary sources into the broader historical context of the period. By combining primary with secondary sources, historians write and tell a story about the past.

Please read this [page of Wikipedia specifying the sources that editors are allowed to use when they write about history on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_source_examples#History).

Then, try to answer the following questions:

- What sources can Wikipedia editors use to create or edit pages related to history? 
- Are the sources that Wikipedia recommends different from the sources that academic historians use?

<!-- The time was estimated as follows: 25 minutes for reading plus 15 minutes for answering/discussing the questions-->

## Assignment 3 - Writing on Wikipedia: Structure and Historical Narrative 

Wikipedia articles include historical narratives about the past. In other words, Wikipedia articles tell a story about the past. The stories are the result of collaborative writing between Wikipedia users, so each article has a different structure based on various combinations of standardized sections (e.g., chapters, sections, infoboxes, hyperlinks), includes different visual and audio elements (e.g., graphs, videos, images, sounds), and bibliographical references. Now, as you have a better understanding of how Wikipedia works, let’s look at the historical narrative of a Wikipedia article.

> You can reproduce the proposed exercice with an article on the historical event, personnality or phenomenon of your choice and in the language you are more confortable with. Examples may include, without being limited to, the Haitian revolution, the Arab Spring, the Silk Road, Cleopatra, feminism, slavery...   

### 3.a Deconstructing a Wikipedian narrative on a historical event | 60 Min   

Browse the article on the [September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) of the English edition of Wikipedia, and please focus on the following elements: 

- How the historical narrative of the Wikipedia article is structured and how it differs from traditional historical narratives that you can find in a book or in an article. 

- The visual and audio materials that are part of the article's narrative. Please pay particular attention to the terms and conditions of use of these elements. 

- The bibliography that the editors have used, the hyperlinks, and the references to other historical events. 

Then, think critically and try to answer the following questions:

- How have Wikipedia users organized the historical narrative of the Wikipedia article?
- What kind of visual and audio materials (e.g., graphs, videos, images, sounds, etc.) does the Wikipedia article include? How do those materials affect the historical narrative of the article?
- How do hyperlinks work and how do they affect the way a potential user reads and understands the article?
- How would you characterize the types of works that Wikipedia users cite in the article? Do they use academic works, journalistic, or any other types? Are the cited works available online?
- Do you detect any similarities or differences between the bibliographical references used in a Wikipedia article and the references used in academic books or articles?

## Assignment 4 - Behind the Scenes of Wikipedia Articles

Many people visit Wikipedia to learn about history. However, few of them probably know that Wikipedia articles are products of long debates, conflicts, collaborations, discussions, and consensus between different Wikipedia editors. Wikipedia's open approach provides us the opportunity to look “behind the scenes” and explore how the articles take shape and change over time. The “talk page” and “view history” pages of Wikipedia reveal the discussions between users on each entry and the logs of all the changes and copies of older versions of the article. Both tabs include significant data for historical research. As Wikipedia users get involved with the creation and editing of articles, they participate in discussions and debates, which provide useful data about how Wikipedians perceive the past, what historical arguments they make, how they try to reach a consensus, etc. In the "view history" tab, there is also data on how the historical narrative of a Wikipedia article changes over time. In this part of the lesson, we will investigate what happens "behind the scenes" of a Wikipedia article by unveiling both the discussions between the users and the editing history of an article. To do that, we will focus on one case study, the [article on the September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) of the English edition of Wikipedia.

> You can reproduce the proposed exercice with an article on the historical event, personnality or phenomenon of your choice and in the language you are more confortable with. Examples may include, without being limited to, the Haitian revolution, the Arab Spring, the Silk Road, Cleopatra, feminism, slavery... Please note that in this case some questions proposed below, specific to the event, may not be relevant.  

### 4.a Historical discussions and debates | 60 Min
The September 11 attacks constitute a traumatic event that shaped modern United States history but also had a broader global impact. If you click on the article's "talk page" tab, you will notice that the discussions are extensive. However, I have collected some examples, which reveal information on how Wikipedia users perceive the past and get involved in debates with other users on how to edit a Wikipedia article. Specifically, the examples below include different types of information, such as how Wikipedians should honor the memory of the victims, how they should describe the people who caused the attacks, what title they should place into the Wikipedia article, etc. So, please click on the links below and read only the sections mentioned in the titles. For more information on "talk pages" and how to use them, see the video in assignment 2.b.

- [Talk on the title of the article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_3#Article_Title) - estimated time of silent reading: 20 minutes
- [Talk on deleting the word terrorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_7#Deleting_terrorist) - estimated time of silent reading: 15 minutes 
- [Talk on the use of terms "terrorist", "terrorism" and "freedom fighter"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_11#%22Terrorist%22,_%22terrorism%22_and_%22freedom_fighter%22) - estimated time of silent reading: 6 minutes 
- [Talk on memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_13#In_Memorium) - estimated time of silent reading: 13 seconds  
- [Talk on memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_21#Memorial) - estimated time of silent reading: 30 seconds  

Then, try to answer the following questions:

- Which topics related to the September 11 attacks do most Wikipedia users discuss?
- Why do Wikipedia users get involved in debates?
- What arguments do they make to support their opinions, and what reactions do they receive from other Wikipedians in the specific case studies?
- How do Wikipedia users perceive the September 11 attacks? Do they express any personal emotions and memories about the past of the September 11 attacks?
- Why do Wikipedians want to edit the September 11 attacks Wikipedia page? What is the meaning of editing for them?
- How do Wikipedia users involved in discussions and debates try to reach a consensus?
- Can you notice changes in the topics raised over time? What does this reveal in your opinion for the perception/reception of the subject of the article? 

### 4.b Narratives in constant motion
The ways historians interrogate and write about the past can change over time. One of the foundations of the historical research is to establish the state of the art of historiography on a given topic, examine its evolution and determine the point it stands. The same happens with Wikipedia narratives. Now let’s see how the Wikipedia article of the September 11 attacks has changed since its creation. 

Please click on the two links below, which contain the most recent editing changes to the article and the editors who made those changes.

1. The **type** of editing changes, e.g., correcting vocabulary and grammar mistakes, adding more visual materials, reorganizing the text of the article, etc. 
2. The **editors** who make those changes.

> For more information on how to use the "view history" portal, please watch the video in assignment 2.b. 

After reading the above extracts, please try to answer the following questions, even though our sample is small (only two pages from a very extensive revision history): 

- How does the historical narrative of the article change over time?
- What types of contributions do editors make? For example, do they correct grammar or spelling mistakes, or do they make major changes in the article?
- By looking at the names of editors, do you notice the existence of bots? What does the collaboration between humans and non-human agents signify for the production of history in the digital age?

## Assignment 5 - Comparing Wikipedias in different languages 

Wikipedia does not exist only in the English language. Instead, it includes 331 active language editions as of July 2024. The different editions are not just simple translations from one language to another but can also propose different narratives. Thus, historical narratives about the past may involve different representations, structures, and discussions. Wikipedia's multilingual character offers one more field to historians to compare historical narratives across different, more popular, cultural perspectives. In this part, we propose to compare two different Wikipedia language editions. Specifically, we will focus on a historical event of French history with global dimensions, May 68, as it is represented in the English and French editions of Wikipedia. 

> You can reproduce the proposed exercice with a case-study of your choice, according to your research interests, and in the languages you are more confortable with. Some examples we can think of: compare the English and Arabic versions of the article on the Arab Spring, the English and Chinese versions of the article on the Silk Road, the English and German versions of the article on the Berlin Wall or any versions you are most interested in. 

### 5.a Comparing Wikipedian perspectives of May 1968 in English and French | 60-120 Min 
May 68 constitutes a major event in the history of France, and also in the broader context of the global social unrest and cultural revolutions of the late 1960s. For this reason, this subassignment focuses on the English language Wikipedia, that contains the most active registered users and covers more articles than other editions, and the French Wikipedia. It proposes to investigate in what ways the interface of Wikipedia encourages a specific way of presenting and displaying historical narratives across different language editions.

> The time of the exercice can vary depending on whether you opt for reading the entire content of articles or selected sections of them.  
 
First, please read the historical narratives of the following two articles:

[May 1968, in English language Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_68#:~:text=Beginning%20in%20May%201968%2C%20a,France%20came%20to%20a%20halt) - silent reading time: 20 minutes

[May 1968, in French language Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mai_68) - silent reading time: 60 minutes
 
After reading both articles, you will notice that even though they refer to the same historical event, the representation of May 1968 is not the same. The two articles have different structures, content, visual elements, and use different bibliographical references.

Now, please check the following questions and discuss your answers with your fellow students:

- What are the main similarities and differences in how the two Wikipedia articles present the May 1968 historical events? Explore both the structure and the content (or parts of the content) of the articles and try to explain these similarities and differences.
- Do you detect any similarities and differences in the bibliography that the two articles cite in the section of references? For example, you can explore if the articles rely more heavily on certain works (or not), the language and the type of the cited resources in each case. Try to explain these similarities and differences.

Write a short text of 500 words with your findings and reflect on what they tell us about the reception of the event in each case.
