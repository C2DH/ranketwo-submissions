Introduction 

In 2021, the American Historical Association published a study on how the American public perceives and understands the past.  The study was based on a national survey of 1,816 people and showed that 46% of respondents turn to Wikipedia to learn about history and acquire a historical understanding of the past. Wikipedia was ranked higher than other historical activities, such as “Historic site visit,” “Museum visit,” “Genealogy work,” “Social media,” “Podcast/radio program,” “History lecture,” and “History-related video game.” But, away from traditional academic and publishing venues, who generates this kind of historical knowledge and how? On Wikipedia, historical knowledge is the result of Wikipedia users’ engagement with history and compliance with Wikipedia guidelines and rules. The purpose of this lesson is to teach historians how they can use Wikipedia as a historical source to explore the production of historical knowledge in the online encyclopedia. This lesson aims to show historians how Wikipedia pages related to history are created and edited by users by investigating the main content of Wikipedia pages and the discussions between users behind the pages. The online discussions reveal interesting information about how Wikipedia users perceive the past (memories, emotions, personal connections) and try to transform it into a Wikipedia page. At the same time, the discussions show how Wikipedia users try to comply with the guidelines and rules of Wikipedia and how they get involved in debates about what to add or remove from a Wikipedia page.
 
The lesson includes a series of assignments, which examine different aspects of historical knowledge production on Wikipedia. The first one helps participants explore the system of Wikipedia with its guidelines and rules that shape the production of history on Wikipedia. The second one allows participants to investigate the main content of Wikipedia articles related to history and the third one asks participants to dive into the discussions and debates that take place behind the creation of a Wikipedia page. The fourth part focuses on two different language editions of Wikipedia, the English and the French language Wikipedia, and asks participants to detect similarities and differences in how a historical event is presented and displayed across different language editions of Wikipedia .
Main lesson 
Part 1 Provide title

Wikipedia as an encyclopedia includes subjects ranging from mathematics and biology to sports, culture, and the arts. Even though all guidelines and policies of Wikipedia are common for all its subjects, there are particular modifications and rules for each subject. The aim of this lesson is to make participants explore the broader system of the Wikipedia community but, at the same time, focus on history as a content subject category of Wikipedia. In that way, participants will identify the guidelines that Wikipedia has established for the collection and dissemination of historical knowledge and understand how Wikipedia manages to motivate its users to create or edit Wikipedia pages. 
 
First, you should visit the following Wikipedia pages that contain useful information on how Wikipedia works and how Wikipedia users can engage with its contents:
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines.
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jimbo_Wales/Statement_of_principles.
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Trifecta.
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars.
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies.
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Talk_pages.
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Page_history. 
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources.
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_source_examples#History.
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:History     
 
Then, you should try to answer the following questions:
●	What are the most important guidelines and policies of Wikipedia? How do they affect the production of historical knowledge on Wikipedia?
●	What are the Wikipedia instructions for editing or creating pages related to history?
●	What sources can Wikipedia editors use to create or edit pages related to history? How does Wikipedia seem to perceive history?
●	How can “talk pages” and “page history” of Wikipedia pages be useful for historians?
●	Considering that Wikipedia consists of multiple guidelines and policies, how does Wikipedia enable its editors to actively engage with its content? Is there any specific policy that encourages the active agency of users?

Part 2 Provide title

Once you have a better understanding of how Wikipedia works and its main guidelines and policies for the production of knowledge, let’s look at the historical narratives of some Wikipedia pages. First, you should read the following Wikipedia pages, which represent three different historical topics, the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Vietnam War, and the September 11 attacks, . While you read them,  and pay attention not only to the text itself but also to how Wikipedia users have organized the text, the visual materials (photographs, videos, sounds) they have placed, the tables, graphs, statistics, bibliographies they have used, the hyperlinks and the references to other historical events. Then, you should think critically and try to answer the following questions:
●	How have Wikipedia users organized the historical narratives of the Wikipedia pages? Do you detect any similarities or differences with the way traditional historians organize their historical narratives in academic books or articles?
●	What kind of visual materials do Wikipedia pages include and how do they affect the historical narrative they present?
●	Do you detect differences and similarities in the way the three events and  narrated?
●	How do hyperlinks work in the three case studies and how do they affect the way a potential user reads and understands a historical narrative?
●	How would you characterize the types of works that Wikipedia users cite in the three case studies? Do they use academic works, journalistic, or any other type? Are the cited works available online?
●	Do you detect any similarities or differences between the three Wikipedia pages and other historical narratives written by traditional historians and published in academic books or articles? 
Part 3  

Wikipedia pages are the final products of editing and discussion between Wikipedia users. In the third part of this lesson, participants will investigate what happens “behind the scenes” of a Wikipedia page by unveiling the discussions and debates that shape the historical narrative of the page. To do that, let’s focus on one case study, the Wikipedia page of the September 11 attacks. As you see in the “talk page” of the article, the discussions are extensive. However, I have collected some examples from the discussions between the users, which reveal interesting information on how Wikipedia users perceive the past and get involved in debates with other users on how to edit a Wikipedia page. So, you should click on the links below and read only the sections mentioned in the parentheses. If there is no parenthesis , please read the whole article.
 
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_2
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_3#Article_Title (Article Title)
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_7#Deleting_terrorist (Deleting terrorist)
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_11#%22Terrorist%22,_%22terrorism%22_and_%22freedom_fighter%22 ("Terrorist", "terrorism" and "freedom fighter")
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_13#In_Memorium (In Memorium)
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_21#Memorial (Memorial)
●	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:September_11_attacks/Archive_31#Actual_editing_-_%22Memorials%22_section (Actual editing - "Memorials" section) 
 
Then, you should try to answer the following questions:
●	Which are the topics that most Wikipedia users discuss about the September 11 attacks?
●	Why do Wikipedia users get involved in debates?
●	What arguments do they make to support their opinions and what reactions do they receive from other Wikipedians?
●	How do Wikipedia users perceive the September 11 attacks? Do they express any personal emotions and memories about the past of the September 11 attacks?
●	Why do Wikipedians want to edit the September 11 attacks Wikipedia page? What is the meaning of editing for them?
●	How do Wikipedia users involved in discussions and debates try to reach a consensus?
Part 4 

Wikipedia does not exist only in the English language; instead, it includes 335 language editions, 322 of which are active and 13 closed, as of September 2023.  In this part, we will compare two different Wikipedia language editions, the English language Wikipedia and the French one. Specifically, we will focus on a specific historical event, the May 1968, as it is represented in the English and French Wikipedia.  The selection of May 1968 is based on a hypothesis that even though the English language Wikipedia contains the most active registered users and covers more articles than other editions, May 1968 took place in France, so it hypothetically affected more a French audience than an English one and there would be better coverage of May 1968 in the French language Wikipedia.   The participants of this course will test this hypothesis by investigating if the interface of Wikipedia encourages a specific way of presenting and displaying across different language editions by comparing the historical narratives of the two articles.
 
You should read the historical narratives of the following two articles:
 
●	May 1968, in English language Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_68#:~:text=Beginning%20in%20May%201968%2C%20a,France%20came%20to%20a%20halt
●	May 1968, in French language Wikipedia, https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mai_68
 
Then, you should try to answer the following questions:
●	What are the main similarities and differences in the way the two Wikipedia articles present the May 1968 historical events? How do you explain these similarities/differences?
●	Which article does it cover May 1968 “better” (extensive analysis, more textual and visual details, etc.) and why?
●	Do you detect any similarities or differences in the bibliography that the two articles cite?
●	Based on these two case studies, does Wikipedia promote a specific way of presenting and displaying a historical event across the two Wikipedia editions? Does the location of a historical event mean better coverage or more user engagement in the related language Wikipedia?
