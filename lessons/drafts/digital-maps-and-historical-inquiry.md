Maps are a means of communication. They give spatial information and orientation, offer spatial guidance but can also deceive. Humans have used maps since ancient times. Nowadays, we are familiar with web map services on our smart phones, such as GoogleMaps or OpenStreetMap. 

There are multiple ways for historians to use maps for historical research. They can serve as primary sources which offer information on spaces at the time they were produced or for insights into how different societies perceived and represented space at different times. However, historians also use maps as analytical tools to convey knowledge or as powerful visualization tools to communicate historical findings and narratives. For this, oftentimes, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which allow for layering of information in the form of data – from demographic information to locations of buildings – and tracking spatial changes over time are used. [CL: Agreed]
The technological tools we have at our disposal today, have transformed how historians access and utilize cartographic resources. In this lesson we will differentiate between two types of maps: (1) maps which were produced in the analogue age but are now accessible as a digital representation online; and (2) maps which were “born digital”. [CL: Agreed]

While maps at first glance might appear to provide objective geographic information it is important to keep in mind that they are not exact replicas of the spaces they represent.  Instead they are complex systems of representation that inherently involve reduction, selection, and standardization that might leave out crucial information by accident, or on purpose. There is no better example for this than Jorge Luis Borges one-paragraph story On Exactitude in Science
…In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a
single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.
—Suarez Miranda,Viajes de varones prudentes, Libro IV,Cap. XLV, Lerida, 1658

This understanding, that a map is an abstraction of reality, relying on preset conventions that vary depending on what story the map should tell and when this story was told and at whom it was addressed, is fundamental to approaching maps in historical research.
