## Introduction

Maps are a means of communication. Humans have used them to provide spatial information based on available knowledge and technologies, since ancient times. Nowadays, we are familiar with interactive web map services on our smart phones. 

Maps offer guidance but can also deceive. While maps at first glance might appear to provide objective geographic information, it is important to keep in mind that they are not exact replicas of the spaces they represent. Instead they are complex systems of representation that inherently involve reduction, selection, and standardization that might leave out crucial information by accident, or on purpose. There is no better example for this than Jorge Luis Borges' one-paragraph story ["On Exactitude in Science"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Exactitude_in_Science): 

> …In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a
single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.
—Suarez Miranda,Viajes de varones prudentes, Libro IV,Cap. XLV, Lerida, 1658

This understanding, that a map is an abstraction of reality, relying on preset conventions that vary depending on what story the map should tell, when this story was told and at whom it was addressed, is fundamental to approaching maps in historical research.

There are multiple ways for historians to use maps for historical research. They can serve as primary sources which offer information on spaces at the time they were produced or for insights into how different societies perceived and represented space at different times. However, historians also use maps as analytical tools to convey knowledge or as powerful visualization tools to communicate historical findings and narratives. For this, oftentimes, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which allow for layering of information in the form of data – from demographic information to locations of buildings – and tracking spatial changes over time are used. 

The technological tools we have at our disposal today, have transformed how historians access and utilize cartographic resources. In this lesson we will differentiate between two types of maps: (1) maps which were produced in the analogue age but are now accessible as a digital representation online; and (2) maps which were “born digital”. 

## 1 Acceding to maps in the digital age: the mediation of the online repository  

*Learning outcome 1 -critically analyze a digital repository to evaluate the provenance of a map* 

*Learning outcome 2 -recognize the variety of digital repositories providing access to maps*

*Learning outcome 3 - identify forms of collaborative participation in maps arcival description*

In the digital age, it is far easier to access maps, than it was before. With the onset of large-scale digitization efforts at libraries and archives, maps have also become far more accessible due to their availability online. Digital libraries and repositories provide manifold cartographic sources. However, the number of openly accessible maps, the quality of digitisation, the technical features linked to the maps as well as additional information provided to each map are highly disparate, **reflecting different purpose or conditions of creation of the archive**, means of funding, **or community investment**.  

### 1.a Interrogating the (digital) map archive
Each online library has its advantages and disadvantages, **but this is highly dependent on the intended use of the resources one wishes to make** and the research question(s). For some projects, a simple map giving an overview over a certain region may be already sufficient; other projects may necessitate very large scale maps including detailed information about the date of production, the publisher, etc. **In any case, the information provided by a map repository should allow historians to establish with certitude the provenance and the origin of the available resources.** 

The following list proposes a selection of online map libraries that can be interesting for historians. There are many more, but we can start exploring here:

[OldMapsOnline](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/){:target="_blank"}

[David Rumsey Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/){:target="_blank"}

[Virtuelles Kartenforum](https://kartenforum.slub-dresden.de/){:target="_blank"}

[Arcanum Maps - The Historical Map Portal](https://maps.arcanum.com/en/){:target="_blank"}

[Virtual Map Collection](http://chartae-antiquae.cz/en/){:target="_blank"}

[Mapster](http://igrek.amzp.pl/){:target="_blank"}

**Please follow the links provided above and compare the different repositories (if your time is limited, pick no less than three to make the comparison). Look for the following information:**

**1. Who is the creator of the website**

**2. Which is the purpose of the website**

**3. What kind of maps the website provides: explore the geographical/thematical scope and language(s) available**

**4. How are the maps displayed? You may find static images, in short photos of digitized maps, or interactive maps, which means they are based on layers of information, that we call Geographical Information Systems (see assignment number 4 )**

**5. Are the maps reusable: downloadable and possible to reuse (republish, remix...) without copyright restrictions? What is the kind of permission the users have if any?** 

### 1.b Describing maps in the archive 
**Now it is time to get an idea of the information you find at the level of the map: this information should allow you to contextualize the creation and availability of the maps, and evaluate them as historical sources. The existence and the quality of systematic descriptions of archival resources, in this case maps, is the added value hidden in the mediation of the archive. It is an essential element for historians who rely on it to contextualize and evaluate their sources.**   

Compare topographic maps which you can find on [Kartenforum](https://kartenforum.slub-dresden.de/){:target="_blank"} and on [Arcanum](https://maps.arcanum.com/en/){:target="_blank"}. **Pick one map you find interesting** in each of these repositories.   What kind of additional information you can you find for each map (date of publication, date of digitization, publisher, author...) Is there information that you would need but is missing? If so, why might that be? What are advantages and disadvantages of these two online libraries concerning accessibility (e.g. can you access the maps easily, download them and reuse them for your own analysis? What research might be done with the maps provided?

### 1.c The collaborative map archive 

**At least two of these websites, [OldMapsOnline](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Virtuelles Kartenforum](https://kartenforum.slub-dresden.de/){:target="_blank"} involve participatory practices based on a [community of contributors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice).** 

**Please explore them and note:** 

**1. What is the purpose of involving community users? What are they asked to do?** 

**2. How can a user be actively involved? What are the actions one needs to take in order to be able to contribute? Note how they can access the resources and contribute as identified user**

**3. Are there specific instructions one has to follow (guidelines)?** 

**4. How are the contributions controlled and validated?**

**5. How are the contributions credited?**

**Now think about how information technologies bring together networks of users and enable the formation of communities. Ask yourself the question: would these contributions be possible without the existence of a website? How could the users have been involved in this case? Would they be able to contribute their knowledge? In what delays? Where?**

## 2 Learning to read the stories maps tell
By Eliane Schmid

*Learning outcome - gaining map literacy to apply source criticism* 

In principle, all maps are thematic. It is possible to distinguish between maps that focus on topographic features on the surface of the Earth, and maps that depict social demographics, public transportation lines, crime, etc. However, the basic steps in the mapping process are relevant for all types of maps: 
1.	Choosing the projection
2.	Defining geographic extents
3.	Designing the map 
4.	Choosing classification methods and categories
5.	Choosing a color scheme for data visualization
6.	Clearly defining the audience
7.	Labeling
8.	Adding a legend
9.	Defining a layout 
10.	Being conscious of visual hierarchy

Although this lesson will not deal with technicalities, it is important to understand how the above steps **articulate with source criticism**. When analyzing maps as historical sources, we start with basic questions: who produced the map, and when? In what purpose and for whom? What is the content of the map? How is the map content presented? **Some of these questions can be answered with the help of descriptive information on maps (as in 1.b), of information contained in other sources, and with applying internal critique on the map content.** We should keep in mind, that the authors, cartographers and editors **(in short: the creators)** of maps have to make decisions in the course of map production to select particular features, objects or information to be represented in the map. They also need to follow conventions regarding map design, i.e. symbolism and styles developed over centuries and especially since the 19th century. Therefore, as the outcome of a chain of decisions, maps filter spatial reality and vehiculate specific perceptions. Thus, maps are media for categorizing, systematizing, levelling and stereotyping spatial features and individual characteristics of the objects depicted on them. They are based on the visual equation of different manifestations of the same phenomenon, arbitrarily set as a standard or group of characteristics. The choice of the area of space that can be seen on a map and the allocation of centres and peripheral locations are already connected.

Watch the video [Reading maps: How to analyze a map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSS1qIEOT8) (2min10). Take notes on what librarian Michelle LeBlanc calls “Big Ideas in Map Analysis” and write a checklist for yourself on what a perfect map should include. Keep this checklist and add to, or edit it as you go through this lesson: in the end you will have created your personal “Catalogue of Map Elements”. **If you need help, you can use [our own notes](/assets/docs/show-to-read-a-map.txt).**

If you wish to see how the above principles are applied to historical map analysis, watch the follow-up video: [Analyzing a map: “Imperial Federation,” 1886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nds2Rg_OOO8&t=107s) (4min01). 

### 2.a Playing with perspective and distorsion 

By Eliane Schmid

*Learning outcome: hands-on experience to understand what a projection does to a map and how it is a construct*

In the video, the discussant talks about map projections as one of the elements defining perspective. **Read the Wikipedia notice to understand [what a map projection is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection) and how distorsion is inherent to it**.   

**Now play with different map projections**. Consult [Country Centered Map Projections](https://engaging-data.com/country-centered-map-projections/) and click on the country you are currently living in. Try different map projections to see how this changes the way the country is being displayed. Think about why different map projections exist. What is their purpose? 

Continue further down the page and read the text below the illustration to learn more about projections. 

### 2.b Decrypting choices, audience, and purpose: imagining populations in maps
By Peter Haslinger

*Learning outcome - apply internal source critique to a map*

Since the 19<sup>th</sup> century, **the rise of nationalisms in Europe and worldwide highlighted the importance of population: ethnicity, language and religion represented high stakes in political antagonisms over perceived majorities and minorities and contested borders. The censuses conducted on a regular basis by states provided a statistical basis for measuring use of language, demographic development, etc. over a longer period. Political debates were reflected in the cartographic production  and census data were used to depict populations - and national(istic) arguments.** 

You will work with two maps that were created in the context of the World War One and used respectively by the Polish and Hungarian delegations during the peace conference in Paris 1919/20 to legitimize national-territorial claims. These examples give insight into aspects of the cartographic debates about populations at the time. Both map authors were founding fathers of geography in their respective countries.

[Eugeniusz Romer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugeniusz_Romer) (1871-1954) had produced maps during the war. In its aftermath, these maps served as cartographic templates for the Polish delegation maps at the Paris peace conference (published as Polski atlas kongresowy in 1921). His high credibility among international geographers and his personal friendships with some experts on the side of the Allied Powers, especially the highly influential American expert [Isaiah Bowman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Bowman), increased the authoritativeness of the maps presented by the Polish delegation among the decision makers. In a map entitled “The political and ethnographical territory of Poland (1772)”, Romer supports a maximalistic approach to Polish territorial claims by the combination of the territory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (“Poland” in its borders of 1772) and additional areas in the west with some Polish populations. We can see the strategy of creating a normative connection between language use and political boundaries.

[Pál Teleki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1l_Teleki) (1879-1941), future Prime Minister on two occasions, became the leading geographer and academic mastermind of Hungarian cartography and geopolitics. Teleki’s extensive language skills had helped establish his international reputation before the war (he spoke German, French, and English, as well as some Dutch, Italian, and Romanian). During the peace negotiations between Hungary and the Allied Powers at Trianon, the official Hungarian delegation promoted the idea that Hungary was one of the most striking morphological units on the physical map of Europe, with a practically uninhabited belt of the Carpathians surrounding most of the country and creating a natural barrier. As a preparation for the peace talks he drafted the famous “carte rouge” as early as December 1918. This map was now used as an attachment to the Hungarian memoranda in order to retain as much territory as possible for Hungary and was published in several editions even after the peace treaty of Trianon had been signed on June 4, 1920. Teleki’s method of not including areas that were less populated, and his choice of colors (light red for Hungarian, faint pink for Romanian) overemphasized the Hungarian-speaking minority population in Transylvania at the expense of the Romanian-speaking majority.

Check the maps and the contextual information provided above. You can also conduct some research on the web. Answer the following questions. 

Context and perspective of creation
* Who made the map? For who? When? 

What does the maps represent:
* What exactly is shown on the maps? 
* What national perspectives are presented in each?

Choices and modalities of the representation: 
* What kind of borders do you see? 
* What do the differently coloured territories stand for? 
* What is the statistical basis for this map? 
* What does the colour red stand for and what visual effect is it supposed to achieve? 
* How should the white areas on the map be interpreted?

Audience and intention: For what purpose? 
* What does the map tell us about the political intention of the map author through the choice of map section and the drawn boundaries?

Now write a short paragraph to summarize your findings: 
* What stories do the maps tell?

**To finish, make a research on the web about both maps, using the title of each as search words. Note which libraries and in which countries the digitized versions of these maps are available. Based on your findings, what are your remarks about the geographic area of diffusion of the digitized versions of the maps?** 

### 2.c Visualizing power 
By Christian Lotz

*Learning outcome - initiation to maps as data visualizations*

Maps can be an impressive tool to visualize power. Political entities - kingdoms, nation states, and empires - have used them to mark borders, to outline territorial ambitions or to demonstrate influence. Cartographers coupled selection of data with techniques of visualization to highlight power and influence and to make arguments. The following example takes up two maps of the world which, from different points of view, show the influence of the British Empire during the 1920s and 1930s.

![Chambers of Commerce Atlas, General Reference Map, 1928](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/chambers-of-commerce-1928-world-map.jpg "Chambers of Commerce Atlas, General Reference Map, 1928")

Figure XX: Chambers of Commerce Atlas, General Reference Map, 1928

The map is part of the „Chambers of Commerce Atlas“, published in London in 1928. The [Chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Chambers_of_Commerce&oldid=1270196576) are one of the main British institution to facilitate world-wide trade. The Atlas was directed to a British audience, and, in any case, any English-speaking readers interested in trade routes as well as the spatial distribution of natural resources and commercial capacities. The “General Reference Map” uses red colour to indicate territories which are linked to the British Empire and the Commonwealth. This is an obvious (and colourful) technique to highlight British influence over the world. However, the map also vehiculates dominant cultural representations of an imperial power, which is obvious in the use of place names: for example, Bombay (in India) and Constantinopole (in Turkey), and not Mumbaī and İstanbul. Although the former were the placenames commonly in use in the English language for these two cities, and therefore familiar to a British audience, their use also suggests a world in which the the United Kingdom is culturally, financially and politically a dominant power. 

**Sofia comment: Maybe it would be interesting to add here this map: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:42-43_%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0.jpg and show how the red is used now for the USSR - could the basis of this map be the previous one?**

![Radó, “International Movements of Capital”, 1938](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/international-movements-of-capital-1938.jpg "International Movements of Capital, 1938")


Figure XX: Radó, “International Movements of Capital”, 1938

The map “International Movements of Capital” belongs to the „Atlas of today and tomorrow“ published by Alexander (Sándor) Radó, also in London, in 1938. The atlas outlines the cleavages of global conflicts in the early 20th century. Most of the maps in the atlas were designed in black and white, some maps additionally include red colour. On the map, circles and arrows demonstrate the amount of capital flowing from major powers to other parts of the world. The visual strength of the map derives from the arrows and lines linking different parts of the world. Various interpretations are possible: Do the lines and arrows demonstrate the competition between the British Empire and the rising power of the United States of America? Or does the map allow for a visual comparison of investment strategies: the British capital is invested overseas, while, for example, French capital mainly goes to Central and Eastern European countries? Or do these lines symbolize dangerous octopuses, reaching out to grab more and more parts of the world?

* Who created the map? When and in what purpose? You can consult the Wikipedia article on the map creator to answer this question. Wikipedia contributors, "Alexander Radó," Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Rad%C3%B3&oldid=1262810919](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Rad%C3%B3&oldid=1262810919) (accessed February 17, 2025).  

* **What do the cercles and arrows represent? How do you interpret different sizes?**

* **The map does not use colours but distinguishes visually categories of countries. What do these categories represent? WHich countries are represented individually and which collectively? Why do you think is that?** 

* **How do you interprete the use of black colour?** 

* **The map does not provide a dynamic (in the sense of interactive) visualization, given its date of creation. It does however have a sense of movement. How is this achieved?**

* **Do you have access to the data the map creator worked with? How do you imagine them?**  

**The part below (and questions above) was added by Sofia**
Now you can take a look to the website [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/).

Consult the About page to understand the mission of the initiative and the contributors.

Pick a map of your choice or use the one we propose: [GDP per capita, 2023](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank).

* What types of visualizations do you have access to besides the map? 
* Do you have access to the data the map creator(s) worked with? 
* Can you trace the origin of the data? Can you contextualize the visualizations by applying source criticism? 
* What other elements and information you find interesting?

## 3 History takes place. Maps as (real-time) data

### 3.a Comparing maps and aerial photography

By Tabitha Redepenning

*Learning outcome - compare and cross-check different technologies representing space*

*Learning outcome - manipulate the digital archive and analyze a corpus of digitized photos of historical sources*

Mapping an area has always been particularly important in warfare because of the need to identify weak points and crucial targets between enemies. On maps for public use, fortifications and military information often remained invisible, at best only outlined in vague shapes or blank spaces. This brings about once more the selections in representations on maps that may deceive. But with World War Two, a new and powerful tool for surveying became popular: aerial photography. Military technology enabled new ways of scouting the surface of the earth for vital infrastructure. Moreover, it was used to evaluate damage caused by air raids. During World War Two, all major belligerent powers pursued aerial reconnaissance, including Germany, Great Britain, the United States of America, and the Soviet Union. An important collection of aerial photography is the National Collection of Aerial Photography (NCAP), which is digitalising thousands of (British and foreign) photographs and make them available on [their website](https://ncap.org.uk/). 

Each series of photographs allows us even to track the route of one specific plane during its flight. 

![Detail of Topographic Map of Stettin, 1945](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/1945-stettin-soviet-1-50000-crop.jpg "Detail of Topographic Map of Stettin, 1945")

Figure XX. Detail of Topographic Map of Stettin, 1945 

The first illustration is a detail of a topographic map of [Stettin/Szczecin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szczecin), a German town until the end of World War Two and currently in Poland, in a scale of 1:50.000, created in 1945. For allied forces, it was a main target due to its harbour, access to the Baltic Sea, and presence of several industries. During the war, bomb raids on Szczecin were done mainly by the UK and US. In the end, Soviet forces conquered the city. After 1945, it was handed over to Polish authorities and remains, up until this day, a town right next to Poland’s border with Germany. In 1945, a Soviet cartographer created this topographic map. The description translates: “This map was produced in 1945 after a 1:25 000 German field-work from 1888, edited in 1911, 28, 29 and 1936”. **This reuse, combined to the change of political authority**, no doubt explain the fact that the labelling of the map is essentially a Cyrillic transliteration of the German toponyms used for the town: “ОБЕРВИК” is “Oberwiek”, the Southern part of the town with several industrial sites. There are more Russian terms at play, such as “больн”, which is the abbreviation for “hospital”. Considering the specific conditions of the creation of the map in the aftermath of the war, and with damages having occurred in the meantime due to military operations, one needs to critically interrogate the accuracy and estimated reliability of this topographic map as a representation of the town in 1945. **The series of aerial photography allows to compare these different kinds of spatial representations and evaluate their sincerity.**  

![Royal Air Force, Aerial Photograph, 28th November 1943](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/1943-11-28_NCAP-3070_TR_crop.png "Royal Air Force, Aerial Photograph, 28th November 1943") 
Figure XX: Royal Air Force, Aerial Photograph, 28th November 1943. 

URL: https://ncap.org.uk/frame/6-1-5-3-254?pos=9 [13.03.2024]
*No Commercial Use or Sale, No Sub-Licensing, no Advertising Use. Include the following statement: Higher resolution images are available from [NCAP](https://ncap.org.uk/).

We work with one photograph of an excursion of the 540 Squadron of the RAF, that took place in November 1943. The photo is part of the NCAP collection: [URL](https://ncap.org.uk/frame/6-1-5-3-254?pos=9) The following information about the image is provided in the file’s metadata: “Location: Pommerensdorf; West Pomeranian Province; Poland; 28th November 1943; Corporate bodies: 540 Squadron (RAF)”. Critically analysing these metadata, we notice as historians: 
* that the name of the town of Stettin does not appear, thus disregarding the municipal incorporation of “Pommerensdorf [sic!]” into Stettin in 1939
* that there is an anachronism in the sense that the town's location is “Poland” even though the photograph dates from a time the city was part of Germany. 
Those research hurdles are a **compromise** between the city’s troubled history **and the needs - sometimes shortcomings - of classifications of the patrimonial collections.**  

Analysing the picture and comparing it to the topographic map, the same train rails, the flow of the river Oder/Odra and the islands are recognisable. But are there objects that are only visible in the photograph? Indeed, while the map shows the train tracks, it does not mark the goods station’s wagon depot. **In the photograph???=>** The hospital buildings can be identified south of the wagon depot and the small park. However, the municipal gasworks across the tracks to the hospital’s East (recognisable by their round building structure) remain hidden on the map. Only information from other maps or the knowledge of the building shapes make the identification possible. This specific part of the town was heavily damaged by bomb raids already in April 1943. Therefore, empty fields, buildings without roofs and even some bomb craters are visible in the photograph. 
**Should we add a conclusion for this comparison?**

**The availability of homogenous series of large numbers of digitized images online, and their metadata, allow to investigate and cross-check sources quickly.** Let's play with some data! 

Track [the flights over Stettin/Szczecin on the NCAP archive](https://ncap.org.uk/search?pos=9%20%5B13.03.2024%5D&archive=6-1-5-3) **that are all organized in the same series and can be sorted with this filter. Check their metadata and note down: 
* How many excursions took place? 
* When were they conducted? 

You can read the Wikipedia articles on the [540 Squadron of the RAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._540_Squadron_RAF) to find complementary information on the flights. After doing this, can you find possible explanations for the route, the timing, and the town areas that were left out?

**Now reflect on the following:**
What advantage does the topographic map have compared to an aerial photograph? Consider the circumstances of aerial photography from this period. Comparing different photographs will give insight. **SOfia comment: Need to provide more guidance and hints here: what could be considered an advantage and for whom? For the researcher?**. 


### 3.b Reporting War 1914 and 2024

By Christian Lotz

*Learning outcome - understand how availability of digital data, internet, and community, impact, democratize, and make more transparent the production and communication of maps* 

Times of war are times of massive map production. While military maps are kept secret during the war, because they depict points of strategic interest, there is a huge number of maps produced for public use to inform about the war (advancement of troops, loss of territory etc) **or as means of propaganda.** Public maps about warfare are a highly sensitive source for historiography, because wars are fought not only with weapons, but also with images. Therefore, we should guide a special focus on questions like who provided information and data to be shown on the map, and what was the particular purpose of the production of such public maps.

In this part of the lesson, we compare maps from World War One and maps of the Russian-Ukrainian War since 2022. During World War One, public maps about the war were mainly published in newspapers and journals. Most of these maps had a relatively small scale, i.e. the map showed a rough sketch of the front line between two countries in a scale of 1:1 Million to 1:5 Million. In case a part of the front line was of particular interest, some publishers added medium scale maps, for example about Verdun and its surroundings on the Franco-German front.

Figure XX: Verein für Kriegshilfe: Map of the Western front as of February 1915

This kind of small scale public maps were issued weekly. The regular rhythm of publication made these maps an important medium of information and propaganda: it showed the progress or non-progress of front lines, it informed readers at least roughly about areas in danger to be directly affected by the war, and it demonstrated gain and loss of territory. However, these small scale maps did not let the reader get closer to the situation along the front line. The armies kept large scale maps secret which showed trenches and fortified places, because publicly known details would allow the enemy to more precisely direct its attacks.

Figure XX: Large scale map, Franco-German front, February 1915 **Is this the right caption for the image above???** Where is this image held? We need to mention this.  

A couple of decades after a war is over, archives in many countries give access to these kind of large scale maps. Usually, such maps were printed by the army map services. Surveying officers at the front line used hand drawn remarks to keep them up to date in order to provide a reliable image of the situation. The question „what is the content of the map“ may lead us to a variety of answers: Of course, the topography of the hills and valleys South of Verdun as well as the tight network of trenches are visible on the map. In addition, we can take the map as a representation of static warfare (armies on both sides fight over just a few hundred meters to capture the opposite trench) and as a representation of a huge grave yard with thousands of soldiers who died in these fields.
Today, we also find many small scale maps about ongoing wars in the world printed in newspapers and journals, for example about the Russian-Ukrainian war since 2022. In addition to newspaper maps, there are many more maps online, small scale and large scale. These digital maps are either static images or web map services that provide specific data and that change of the course of time.

The example of the LiveUAmap is a multi-scale map. In a small scale it allows for an overview, in large scale the user can zoom in to the front line in a particular region. The content of the map derives from various sources, such as the Telegramm messager service. The LiveUAmap is provided by a Non Governmental Organisation based in McLean (Virginia, USA). Although we can zoom in to a large scale map, and although we can find information about the front line in detail, the map does not provide data about the positions of fortified places or military installations on the Ukrainian side.

Check the above map and explore the sources of information that are located on LiveUAmap. **It is not clear if what you want here is to check the sources of geo information, for ex. OpenStreetMap, or the sources in the news feed on the right: this must be clarified** 

There are more online maps about the Russian-Ukrainian war. Analyse differences between LiveUAmap and maps provided by the [Institute for the Study of War](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-march-11-2024). **For example, you could use [this map](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Luhansk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20March%2011%2C2024.png).**

**Comparing maps from World War One and the Ukrainian War, what do you notice when applying source criticism (refer to the list provided in assignement 2)? Are you able to identify the context of creation, the intention of the maps and the provenance of information? What do you notice about the creators? Is there something that changes and why?** 

### Reading/viewing suggestions of: 3 History takes place. Maps as (real-time) data

## 4 Datasets as maps: exploring historical Geographical Information Systems (GIS)

### 4.a Understanding the concept of layered information
By Eliane Schmid 

GIS ≠ Maps. A [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) is a software that allows us to display data on a [georeferenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georeferencing) area (this means we have a digital map encoded with [geographic coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system) ==> we have a map, created digitally, where the area that it represents is attached to geographic coordinates e.g. its exact geographic positions on earth represented mathematically) for analytical purposes. By displaying data (for example the number of inhabitants per neighborhood in a city), we can determine any spatial patterns that may exist, or present results of previous analytical work. 

GIS allows the layering of information. **One could think of it as transparent sheets put on top of each other and held by a digital map: one of them showing roads, another rivers, another flagging the exact places where battles happened a given year. Each "layer" contains different types of data that you can turn on or off to see patterns and connections.** As historians, we can layer different historical sources **e.g. census data, trade routes, or historical events** and analyze spatial change over time **or discover connections that aren't obvious when looking at the sources.** 

To understand what this can look like, access the [“Spatio-Temporal Map”](https://ww2.lu/spatiotemporal-map) of the online exhibition World War II Luxembourg. 
* First, explore the maps. There are four different maps that you can chose from. 
* Click on them one by one and notice how different the same space is represented each time. 
* Describe briefly what each layer represents. 
* Zoom in and out to see which layers have limits and which ones extend far beyond the borders of Luxembourg, or Europe. Why is that? 
* Study the most colorful map carefully: 
  * What does it depict? 
  * How does its appearance change when you change the map lying underneath it? 
  * Why is it projected at an angle?

Turning on and off these so-called layers is a simple, yet pertinent example of GIS. These four different maps are four different layers of information that we can call upon and rearrange. They are four different ways of visualizing spatial data. 

Now compare this to your everyday use of Google Maps and the different functions you have there: Did you ever think about these functions as an act of activating and deactivating layers of information? Play around with Google Maps on your browser or smartphone and think about the information that can be revealed or hidden. Type different key word searches, such as ‘pharmacy’ or ‘train station’ and think of these in terms of information layers that are being turned on and off. You may also build yourself a layer of data to add it in a map, guided by the exercise that follows. 

### 4.b What’s in a name? Street names as a reflection of local histories
By Werner Tschacher, Stefan Krebs

*Learning outcome - hands-on experience of working with geospatial data through critical engagement with local history*


> This assignment is based on a [teaching dossier](https://minett-stories.lu/media/pdf/education/street-names-dossier-en.pdf) that was elaborated as part of the online exhibition [“Minett Stories”](https://minett-stories.lu/), a result of the research project “Remixing Industrial Pasts in the Digital Ages”, carried out with the support of Esch2022 asbl. between 2019 and 2023 at the Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C2DH) at the University of Luxembourg. The assignment can be adapted to other national/local contexts for which geospatial data are available. 

Landscape and place names play an important role as reference points for regional identity. In the south of Luxembourg, these names have changed several times in connection with the industrial transformation of the landscape. Before industrialisation, the entire southern region in Luxembourg was part of a larger region known traditionally as “Gutland” because of its fertile soil. When the southern region entered the industrial age in 1850, it was first the landscape that changed and then the names. As iron ore mining intensified, industrial open-cast mining and quarrying underground brought the colour of the red-brown minette ore to the surface at more and more points in the green landscape.

Industrialisation tore the land up, deforesting areas and building production sites on them. Contemporary sources testify that new region names were created after the mid-19th century that related to the mining activities of extracting the minette ore: “Minett” area and “Rote Erde” (Red Earth). Literally, the French word “minette” means small mine or small vein, given the low iron content of the ore. Thus, the naming (and renaming) of what is known currently as the Minett reflect the industrial development of the region. > Source: Werner Tschacher, Naming the Minett, _Minett Stories_, 2022, available at: [https://minett-stories.lu/en/story/naming-and-renaming-of-the-luxembourg-southern-region](https://minett-stories.lu/en/story/naming-and-renaming-of-the-luxembourg-southern-region)

Let us examine the traces of this historical heritage at the scale of Luxembourg’s second largest city, [Esch-sur-Alzette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esch-sur-Alzette). The traditional centre of the Minett region, often referred to as the “Métropole du fer” or “rote Stadt” \[red town\] in the 20th century.

For this exercise, you will use [Luxembourg’s national official geoportal](https://www.geoportail.lu/en/), a governmental [web portal to collect, describe, show and deliver geospatial data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoportal). Geoportals are essential infrastructures for one to find good quality geospatial data - imagine them as libraries that enable you to work with this kind of data. 

Please go to the [street name directory of the city of Esch-sur-Alzette](https://map.geoportail.lu/addresses/Esch-sur-Alzette/?lang=en) to access the exhaustive list of all of the city’s street names. Then, look for those that are associated with the subject of industry - there are several such names with various references: general names (e.g. Rue de l’Acier, Rue de l’Industrie, Rue de l‘Usine), former steelworks and mines (e.g. An der Schmelz, Avenue des Hauts-Fourneaux, Ennert den Héchiewen, Rue des Mines), job titles (e.g. Avenue des Sidérurgistes, Rue des Fondeurs, Rue des Mineurs) and the names of inventors and industrialists (e.g. Rue Henry Bessemer, Place Norbert Metz, Rue Émile Mayrisch, Rue Léon Metz, Rue Sidney Thomas). All these names refer to the multiple facets of the industrial history of the Minett region and its centre, Esch-sur-Alzette. The same applies to other towns and locations in the southern region such as Pétange, Differdange, Dudelange, Bettembourg, Rumelange.

Make a list of the street names you found and reflect on them (or discuss the names if you work in groups). Try to establish a typology that regroups these names into categories (names of places, names of persons, names of professions etc).

> Tip: you can compare the list you established with our non-exhaustive [list](/assets/docs/industrial-streetnames-esch.txt) 

Carry out online research and collect information and photos about the different street names. Prepare short information files about each street name. For example, for a person you can note birth and death dates, professional quality, link to the city’s industrial past, any other information you find relevant. Or, for a place named after a profession, you can search the origins of the name, the evolution of professional activity, relics of the activity in the street. If you wish to dig deeper, you may conduct research to the town archives or interview people.

Finally, you can do some field work: visit the streets you found and familiarise yourself with the location and surroundings. You can check if there are any visible traces associating the streets with the historical past that served to name them: architectural constructions, monuments, relics of past activities… If you find any, take photos on your phone or, at the very least, of the street signs.

Now you have enough information to link to geospatial data and to create your own map! You can use a service like [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/) (or, if you wish to use an interface in French and open source software, [GoGoCarto](https://gogocarto.fr/), instructions are provided in the French version of this lesson). 

To use Google Maps, you need to have a personal Google account and review the instructions available in: Clifford, Jim, Josh MacFadyen, and Daniel Macfarlane. “Intro to Google Maps and Google Earth.” _Programming Historian 2_ (2013), [https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0028](https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0028)  

You could simply create a map by tagging the names of the streets related to the industrial past of Esch-sur-Alzette. Or you could go a step further and integrate the photos you made during your field work. Now, by doing so, it is you who creates a new layer and integrate it in a user-friendly version of a GIS that Google Maps is. If you publish your map, please contact us to integrate the link in this lesson!

### 4.c Evaluating GIS datasets about historical phenomena

By Christian Lotz

*Learning outcome - explore the nature of GIS datasets and understand the need to exercise historical data criticism* 

This assignment does not provide an initiation to GIS and mapping software, as such resources are already available online (see reading suggestions below). Instead, it focuses on how historians can critically evaluate available GIS datasets and the maps which were created based on these data. 

**Simply put, GIS data, that we call [geopackages](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopackage), are a combination of folders containing spatial data, attribute data, and metadata. The spatial data are necessary to create the representation of the space the map focuses on, whereas the attribute data serve to describe it with a variety of features, depending the point of view/intention of the map. These data create the layers of the map. Finally, the metadata provide descriptive and technical information about the two other types of data. Once imported in a GIS software, these data serve to create the layers of the map - that we previously imagined as sheets of different information attached to a map.** 

GIS data are available in various repositories such as [Harvard-GIS](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/harvard-geospatial-library){:target="_blank"} **which is specialized in geospatial data. They can also be available in scientific repositories not necessarily specialized in geospatial data, or centralized repositories where governments enable publishing of open datasets.** Historians, as other users, can download geopackages from these repositories to use them with the software of their choice. **Or they can create and contribute their own datasets.** 

Regarding digital source criticism, we should focus on the following questions: 

* What is the origin of the data, which were used to create the dataset? 
* How did the creators of the dataset transform the original information into data? What kind of categories did the creators of the dataset **privilege** to transform the information into data?
**What are the technical components and environment that may have had an impact on the creation of the dataset?**  

**Good quality metadata, and the existence of detailed documentation, are crucial elements for evaluating the datasets, as some of the information necessary for the above may be available there. Sometimes, information about the dataset is provided in specific scientific publications, the data papers (peer reviewed articles describing a dataset).**

**Let's investigate some information on two datasets imported and opened with QGIS software, displayen in the two screenshots below.** 

The screenshot below (figure XX) shows the dataset about the Kingdom of Poland as part of the Russian Empire at the beginning of the 19th century. The dataset comes from the [Imperiia Project](https://imperiia.omeka.fas.harvard.edu/) run by researcher Kelly O’Neill at Harvard University. The Imperiia Project created data sets about the administrative borders of the Russian Empire.
The authors of the data set describe the preparation of data and the sources from which they extracted the information about borders. For each administrative entity, its name in Russian with Cyrillic alphabet and a latin transliteration are given.

![Kingdom of Poland as part of the Russian Empire in the 19th c., visualization of a dataset obtained in QGIS](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/Abb-5-1_QGIS_Imperiia-Project_02.jpg "Visualization of a historical dataset, Imperiia project, in QGIS - the Kingdom of Poland as part of the Russian Empire in the 19th c.")
**Dataset reference: O’Neill, Kelly. 2016. “Administrative Boundaries of the Russian Empire (1820s): Provinces (Oblasti).” Harvard Dataverse. https://doi.org/doi:10.7910/DVN/5LUP5S.** 

The following screenshot (figure XX) shows a dataset about the border of the partitions of Poland. The data set was created by Christopher Winters at Chicago University. Compared to the previous dataset, the amount of additional information to the data set is very different. While the Imperiia Project provides sources for the data set, there are no sources given in Winters‘ data set. The absence of sources does not mean that the data set is wrong or that the depicted line of border is not correct. However, from a historian‘s perspective, it is far more difficult to deal with material that does not provide any information about its origin.

Library of the University of Chicago. https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/collections/maps/uofcgis.html**

Browse the resources available on the website [The Historical GIS Research Network](http://hgis.org.uk/). Explore available datasets and compare them. In particular, look for information about the origin of the data, about the conception and the creation of the data, and the technical environment of the inception of the dataset.

## 5 Counter-Cartography: shaking up the idea of a “scientific” map

By Eliane Schmid 

All the different map examples you have studied above, have shown how varied the design of maps can be, despite the existence of a set of elements that most maps ought to include. We have also learned, that the primary goal of mapping is to pass on information: map users should get a spatial sense and understanding of data, as well as engage with a specific story.
But beyond these more conventional examples of maps, there is also a movement to uncloak maps from their scientific veil. Maps do not depict the one truth. We learned in the story On Exactitude in Science that this is neither possible nor desirable.

### 5.a 

Watch the first 6 minutes of [This Is Not an Atlas - A Documentary on Counter-Cartographies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8-GKyy3j6I). 

Then answer the following questions: 

* Why should we rethink the trustworthiness of maps? 
* What does it take to remove the “counter” in counter-cartography? 
* Are the maps in assignments A1 and A2 examples of cartography that need to be reassessed? <!--we need to mention specific maps here but I am lost with A1 and A2, see with Eliane>

### 5.b 
Explore the archived version of the website [Remapping Zurich](https://web.archive.org/web/20250124071233/https://remappingzurich.ch/).

*	What different kinds of mapping did this project engage with? Do they still count as maps? Why? Why not? 
*	What is the benefit of maps not being “scientific”? How can we play with different designs?
*	Why are maps such powerful tools for communication? How can this be useful in historical analysis and dissemination?
*	What is the value of thinking about space? How can it help us become conscious of different lived experiences – also in the past?

### 5.c 

Draw two maps of your daily commute to school, university, work, hobby, or similar. One map should depict the path you take in the morning, on a warm and sunny day, where everything goes according to plan. The other map should illustrate your path home, when it is dark, rainy and cold, and something does not go according to plan: there is a train strike, a traffic jam, your bike has a flat tire, you need to pick up your child from pre-school earlier, you forget your keys, etc. 

How do your maps differ depending on the time of day and the contextual circumstances? Is it the same map? Are some elements more prominent than others? Do you take a different path? 

Think about how your personal background shapes the way you perceive space and how you consequently represent that perception on a piece of paper. Think about how your map design would change if you had a different personal background. How would that change your design?
