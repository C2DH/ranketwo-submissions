Maps are a means of communication. Humans have used them to provide spatial information based on available knowledge and technologies, since ancient times. Nowadays, we are familiar with interactive web map services on our smart phones. 

Maps offer guidance but can also deceive. While maps at first glance might appear to provide objective geographic information, it is important to keep in mind that they are not exact replicas of the spaces they represent. Instead they are complex systems of representation that inherently involve reduction, selection, and standardization that might leave out crucial information by accident, or on purpose. There is no better example for this than Jorge Luis Borges' one-paragraph story []"On Exactitude in Science"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Exactitude_in_Science): 

> …In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a
single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.
—Suarez Miranda,Viajes de varones prudentes, Libro IV,Cap. XLV, Lerida, 1658

This understanding, that a map is an abstraction of reality, relying on preset conventions that vary depending on what story the map should tell, when this story was told and at whom it was addressed, is fundamental to approaching maps in historical research.

There are multiple ways for historians to use maps for historical research. They can serve as primary sources which offer information on spaces at the time they were produced or for insights into how different societies perceived and represented space at different times. However, historians also use maps as analytical tools to convey knowledge or as powerful visualization tools to communicate historical findings and narratives. For this, oftentimes, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which allow for layering of information in the form of data – from demographic information to locations of buildings – and tracking spatial changes over time are used. 

The technological tools we have at our disposal today, have transformed how historians access and utilize cartographic resources. In this lesson we will differentiate between two types of maps: (1) maps which were produced in the analogue age but are now accessible as a digital representation online; and (2) maps which were “born digital”. 

## 1 Acceding to maps in the digital age: the mediation of the online repository  

*Learning outcome 1 -critically analyze a digital repository to evaluate the provenance of a map* 
*Learning outcome 2 -recognize the variety of digital repositories providing access to maps* 

In the digital age, it is far easier to access maps, than it was before. With the onset of large-scale digitization efforts at libraries and archives, maps have also become far more accessible due to their availability online. Digital libraries and repositories provide manifold cartographic sources. However, the number of openly accessible maps, the quality of digitisation, the technical features linked to the maps as well as additional information provided to each map are highly disparate, **reflecting different purpose or conditions of creation of the archive**, means of funding, **or community investment**.  

### 1a Interrogating the (digital) map archive
Each online library has its advantages and disadvantages, **but this is highly dependent on the intended use of the resources one wishes to make** and the research question(s). For some projects, a simple map giving an overview over a certain region may be already sufficient; other projects may necessitate very large scale maps including detailed information about the date of production, the publisher, etc. **In any case, the information provided by a map repository should allow historians to establish with certitude the provenance and the origin of the available resources.** 

The following list proposes a selection of online map libraries that can be interesting for historians. There are many more, but we can start exploring here:

[OldMapsOnline](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/){:target="_blank"}

[David Rumsey Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/){:target="_blank"}

[Virtuelles Kartenforum](https://kartenforum.slub-dresden.de/){:target="_blank"}

[Arcanum Maps - The Historical Map Portal](https://maps.arcanum.com/en/){:target="_blank"}

[Virtual Map Collection](http://chartae-antiquae.cz/en/){:target="_blank"}

[Mapster](http://igrek.amzp.pl/){:target="_blank"}

**Please follow the links provided above and compare the different repositories (if your time is limited, pick no less than three to make the comparison). Look for the following information: 
1. Who is the creator of the website
2. Which is the purpose of the website
3. What kind of maps the website provides: explore the geographical/thematical scope and language(s) available
4. How are the maps displayed? You may find static images, in short photos of digitized maps, or interactive maps, which means they are based on layers of information, that we call Geographical Information Systems (see assignment number ... )
5. Are the maps reusable: downloadable and possible to reuse (republish, remix...) without copyright restrictions? What is the kind of permission the users have if nay?  

### 1b The collaborative map archive 

At least two of these websites, [OldMapsOnline](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Virtuelles Kartenforum](https://kartenforum.slub-dresden.de/){:target="_blank"} involve participatory practices based on a [community of contributors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice). 

Please explore them and note: 
1. What is the purpose of involving community users? What are they asked to do? 
2. How can a user be actively involved? What are the actions one needs to take in order to be able to contribute? Note how they can access the resources and contribute as identified user
3. Are there specific instructions one has to follow (guidelines)? 
4. How are the contributions controlled and validated? 
5. How are the contributions credited? 

### 1c Describing maps in the archive 
**Now it is time to get an idea of the information you find at the level of the map: this information should allow you to contextualize the creation and availability of the maps, and evaluate them as historical sources. The existence and the quality of systematic descriptions of archival resources, in this case maps, is the added value hidden in the mediation of the archive. It is an essential element for historians who rely on it to contextualize and evaluate their sources.**   

Compare topographic maps which you can find on [Kartenforum](https://kartenforum.slub-dresden.de/){:target="_blank"} and on [Arcanum](https://maps.arcanum.com/en/){:target="_blank"}. **Pick one map you find interesting** in each of these repositories.   What kind of additional information you can you find for each map (date of publication, date of digitization, publisher, author...) Is there information that you would need but is missing? If so, why might that be? What are advantages and disadvantages of these two online libraries concerning accessibility (e.g. can you access the maps easily, download them and reuse them for your own analysis? What research might be done with the maps provided?

## 2 Learning to read the stories maps tell

*Learning outcome - gaining map literacy to apply source criticism* 

In principle, all maps are thematic. It is possible to distinguish between maps that focus on topographic features on the surface of the Earth, and maps that depict social demographics, public transportation lines, crime, etc. However, the basic steps in the mapping process are relevant for all types of maps: 
1.	Choosing the projection
2.	Defining geographic extents
3.	Designing the map 
4.	Choosing classification methods and categories
5.	Choosing a color scheme for data visualization
6.	Clearly defining the audience
7.	Labeling
8.	Adding a legend
9.	Defining a layout 
10.	Being conscious of visual hierarchy

Although this lesson will not deal with technicalities, it is important to understand how the above steps **articulate with source criticism**. When analyzing maps as historical sources, we start with basic questions: who produced the map, and when? In what purpose and for whom? What is the content of the map? How is the map content presented? **Some of these questions can be answered with the help of descriptive information on maps (an in 1c), of information contained in other sources, and with applying internal critique on the map content.** We should keep in mind, that the authors, cartographers and editors **(in short: the creators)** of maps have to make decisions in the course of map production to select particular features, objects or information to be represented in the map. Theay also need to follow conventions regarding map design, i.e. symbolism and styles developed over centuriesand especially since the 19th century. Therefore, as the outcome of a chain of decisions, maps filter spatial reality and vehiculate specific perceptions. Thus, maps are media for categorizing, systematizing, levelling and stereotyping spatial features and individual characteristics of the objects depicted on them. They are based on the visual equation of different manifestations of the same phenomenon, arbitrarily set as a standard or group of characteristics. The choice of the area of space that can be seen on a map and the allocation of centres and peripheral locations are already connected.

Watch the video [Reading maps: How to analyze a map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSS1qIEOT8) (2min10). Take notes on what librarian Michelle LeBlanc calls “Big Ideas in Map Analysis” and write a checklist for yourself on what a perfect map should include. Keep this checklist and add to, or edit it as you go through this lesson: in the end you will have created your personal “Catalogue of Map Elements”. **If you need help, you can use [our own notes](/assets/docs/show-to-read-a-map.txt).**

If you wish to see how the above principles are applied to historical map analysis, watch the follow-up video: [Analyzing a map: “Imperial Federation,” 1886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nds2Rg_OOO8&t=107s) (4min01). 

### 2a Playing with perspective and distorsion 

In the video, LeBlanc talks about map projections as one of the elements defining perspective. **Read the Wikipedia notice to understand [what a map projection is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection) and how distorsion is inherent to it**.   

**Now play with different map projections**. Consult [Country Centered Map Projections](https://engaging-data.com/country-centered-map-projections/) and click on the country you are currently living in. Try different map projections to see how this changes the way the country is being displayed. Think about why different map projections exist. What is their purpose? 

Continue further down the page and read the text below the illustration to learn more about projections. 

### 2b Decrypting choices, audience, and purpose: imagining populations in maps

Since the 19<sup>th</sup> century, **the rise of nationalisms in Europe and worldwide highlighted the importance of population: ethnicity, language and religion represented high stakes in political antagonisms over perceived majorities and minorities and contested borders. The censuses conducted on a regular basis by states provided a statistical basis for measuring use of language, demographic development, etc. over a longer period. Political debates were reflected in the cartographic production  and census data were used to depict populations - and national(istic) arguments.** 

You will work with two maps that were created in the context of the World War One and used respectively by the Polish and Hungarian delegations during the peace conference in Paris 1919/20 to legitimize national-territorial claims. These examples give insight into aspects of the cartographic debates about populations at the time. Both map authors (Eugeniusz Romer, and Pál Teleki, 1879-1941) were founding fathers of geography in their respective countries.

[Eugeniusz Romer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugeniusz_Romer) (1871-1954) had produced maps during the war. In its aftermath, these maps served as cartographic templates for the Polish delegation maps at the Paris peace conference (published as Polski atlas kongresowy in 1921). His high credibility among international geographers and his personal friendships with some experts on the side of the Allied Powers, especially the highly influential American expert [Isaiah Bowman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Bowman), increased the authoritativeness of the maps presented by the Polish delegation among the decision makers. In a map entitled “The political and ethnographical territory of Poland (1772)”, Romer supports a maximalistic approach to Polish territorial claims by the combination of the territory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (“Poland” in it’s borders of 1772) and additional areas in the west with some Polish populations. We can see the strategy of creating a normative connection between language use and political boundaries.

![“Population - Romer 1916 Atlas Polski - Nr-9-Polacy 1922 A188”](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/population-romer-1916-atlas-polski-nr-9-Polacy-1922-A188.jpg "Romer 1916 Atlas Polski")


[Pál Teleki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1l_Teleki) (1879-1941), future Prime Minister on two occasions, became the leading geographer and academic mastermind of Hungarian cartography and geopolitics. Teleki’s extensive language skills had helped establish his international reputation before the war (he spoke German, French, and English, as well as some Dutch, Italian, and Romanian). During the peace negotiations between Hungary and the Allied Powers at Trianon, the official Hungarian delegation promoted the idea that Hungary was one of the most striking morphological units on the physical map of Europe, with a practically uninhabited belt of the Carpathians surrounding most of the country and creating a natural barrier. As a preparation for the peace talks he drafted the famous “carte rouge” as early as December 1918. This map was now used as an attachment to the Hungarian memoranda in order to retain as much territory as possible for Hungary and was published in several editions even after the peace treaty of Trianon had been signed on June 4, 1920. Teleki’s method of not including areas that were less populated, and his choice of colors (light red for Hungarian, faint pink for Romanian) overemphasized the Hungarian-speaking minority population in Transylvania at the expense of the Romanian-speaking majority.

Check the maps and the contextual information provided above. You can also conduct some research on the web. Answer the following questions. 

COntext and perspective of creation
* Who made the map? For who? When? 

What does the maps represent:
* What exactly is shown on the maps? 
* What national perspectives are presented in each?

Choices and modalities of the representation: 
* What kind of borders do you see? 
* What do the differently coloured territories stand for? 
* What is the statistical basis for this map? 
* What does the colour red stand for and what visual effect is it supposed to achieve? 
* How should the white areas on the map be interpreted?

Audience and intention: For what purpose? 
* What does the map tell us about the political intention of the map author through the choice of map section and the drawn boundaries?

Now write a short paragraph to summarize your findings: 
* What stories do the maps tell?

**To finish, make a research on the web about both maps, using the title of each as search words. Note which libraries and in which countries the digitized versions of these maps are available. Based on your findings, what are your remarks about the geographic area of diffusion of the digitized versions of the maps?**

### 2c Visualizing power 

Maps can be an impressive tool to visualize power. Political entities - kingdoms, nation states, and empires - have used them to mark borders, to outline territorial ambitions or to demonstrate influence. Cartographers coupled selection of data with techniques of visualization to highlight power and influence. The following example takes up two maps of the world which show the influence of the British Empire during the 1920s and 1930s.

![Chambers of Commerce Atlas, General Reference Map, 1928](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/chambers-of-commerce-1928-world-map.jpg "Chambers of Commerce Atlas, General Reference Map, 1928")

Figure: Chambers of Commerce Atlas, General Reference Map, 1928

The map is part of the „Chambers of Commerce Atlas“, published in London in 1928. The Chambers are one of the main British institution to facilitate world-wide trade. The Atlas was directed to British and other English speaking readers interested in trade routes as well as the spatial distribution of natural resources and commercial capacities. The “General Reference Map” uses red colour to indicate territories which belong to the British Empire. Besides this obvious (and colourful) technique to highlight British influence over the world, there are a few less obvious techniques, such as the use of place names: For example, the map uses the names Bombay (in India) and Constantinopole (in Turkey), and not Mumbaī and İstanbul, because  Bombay and Constantinopole were the names commonly in use in English language for these two cities. For British readers, these place names gave suitable orientation. At the same time, the use of these place names suggests a world which is British, or at least: a world that is an English speaking world. While English was (and is) of course a main language for global trade, these place names neglect the presence of other cultures and languages, which could have been represented in place names like Mumbaī, İstanbul and others.

![Radó, “International Movements of Capital”, 1938](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/international-movements-of-capital-1938.jpg "International Movements of Capital, 1938")


Figure: Radó, “International Movements of Capital”, 1938

The map “International Movements of Capital” belongs to the „Atlas of today and tomorrow“ published by Alexander (Sándor) Radó, also in London, in 1938. The atlas outlines the cleavages of global conflicts in the early 20th century. Most of the maps in the atlas were designed in black and white, some maps additionally include red colour. On the map, circles and arrows demonstrate the amount of capital flowing from major powers to other parts of the world. The visual strength of the map derives from the arrows and lines linking different parts of the world. Various interpretations are possible: Do the lines and arrows demonstrate the competition between the British Empire and the rising power of the United States of America? Or does the map allow for a visual comparison of investment strategies: the British capital is invested overseas, while, for example, French capital mainly goes to Central and Eastern European countries? Or do these lines symbolize dangerous octopuses, reaching out to grab more and more parts of the world?

## Spatial representations as data / Exactitude 

Mapping an area has always been particularly important in warfare because of the need to identify weak points and crucial targets between enemies. On maps for public use, fortifications and military information often remained invisible, at best only outlined in vague shapes or blank spaces. One could argue due to the cruciality of this information, maps published by administrative authorities are the most precise ones. Nevertheless, the existence of precise maps posed the danger of them falling into enemies’ hands. So, even with topographic maps by administrative authorities, a critical analysis is needed to understand the content of the map. With World War II, a new and powerful tool for surveying became popular: aerial photography. Military technology enabled new ways of scouting the surface of the earth for vital infrastructure. Moreover, it was used to evaluate damage caused by air raids. 

During World War II, all major belligerent powers pursued aerial reconnaissance, including Germany, Great Britain, the United States of America, and the Soviet Union. An important collection of aerial photography is the National Collection of Aerial Photography (NCAP), which is digitalising thousands of (British and foreign) photographs and make them available on [their website](https://ncap.org.uk/). 

Each series of photographs allows us even to track the route of one specific plane during its flight. 

![Detail of Topographic Map of Stettin, 1945](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/1945-stettin-soviet-1-50000-crop.jpg "Detail of Topographic Map of Stettin, 1945")

Illustration 2.1: Detail of Topographic Map of Stettin, 1945 

The first illustration is a detail of a topographic map of Stettin in a scale of 1:50.000, created in 1945. Until the end of World War II, [Stettin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szczecin){:target="_blank"} was a German town. For allied forces, it was a main target due to its harbour, access to the Baltic Sea, and several industries. During the war, bomb raids on Szczecin were done mainly by the UK and US. In the end, Soviet forces conquered the city. After 1945, it was handed over to Polish authorities and remains, up until this day, a town right next to Poland’s border with Germany. In 1945, a Soviet cartographer created this topographic map. The description translates: “This map was produced in 1945 after a 1:25 000 German field-work from 1888, edited in 1911, 28, 29 and 1936”. This explains the first curiosity. The labelling is a Cyrillic transliteration of the German terms for the city: “ОБЕРВИК” is “Oberwiek”, the Southern part of the town with several industrial sites. It is mixed with Russian expressions, such as “больн” ( the abbreviation for “hospital”). What errors might have occurred when considering the specific conditions of  map production? What is the estimated reliability of this topographic map as a representation of the city in 1945?

![Royal Air Force, Aerial Photograph, 28th November 1943](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/1943-11-28_NCAP-3070_TR_crop.png "Royal Air Force, Aerial Photograph, 28th November 1943") 
Illustration 2.2: Royal Air Force, Aerial Photograph, 28th November 1943. 

URL: https://ncap.org.uk/frame/6-1-5-3-254?pos=9 [13.03.2024]

The NCAP provides the following information about the image in the file’s metadata: “Location: Pommerensdorf; West Pomeranian Province; Poland; 28th November 1943; Corporate bodies: 540 Squadron (RAF)”. Interestingly, it shows the city's current nationality (“Poland”), instead of the nationality during World War II (i.e. Germany). In addition, it does not regard the municipal incorporation of “Pommerensdorf [sic!]” into Stettin in 1939. Those research hurdles are the results of the city’s troubled history. 

Analysing the picture and comparing it to the topographic map, the same train rails, the flow of the river Oder/Odra and the islands are recognisable. What objects are only visible in the photograph? While the train tracks are shown, the map does not mark the goods station’s wagon depot. The hospital buildings can be identified south of the wagon depot and the small park. However, the municipal gasworks across the tracks to the hospital’s East (recognisable by their round building structure) remain hidden on the map. Only information from other maps or the knowledge of the building shapes make the identification possible. This specific part of the town was heavily damaged by bomb raids already in April 1943. Therefore, empty fields, buildings without roofs and even some bomb craters are visible in the photograph. 

Assignment 2.1.: Track [the flights over Stettin/Szczecin on the NCAP archive](https://ncap.org.uk/search?pos=9%20%5B13.03.2024%5D&archive=6-1-5-3) by using the interactive map. How many were there, and when were they conducted? 

Read the Wikipedia articles on the squadrons, e.g. [540 Squadron RAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._540_Squadron_RAF) of the flights as help. What are possible explanations for the route, the timing, and which city areas were left out?

Assignment 2.2. What advantage does the topographic map have compared to an aerial photograph? Consider the circumstances of aerial photography from this period. Comparing different photographs will give insight.
