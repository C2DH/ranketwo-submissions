Maps are a means of communication. Humans have used them to provide spatial information based on available knowledge and technologies, since ancient times. Nowadays, we are familiar with interactive web map services on our smart phones. 

Maps offer guidance but can also deceive. While maps at first glance might appear to provide objective geographic information, it is important to keep in mind that they are not exact replicas of the spaces they represent. Instead they are complex systems of representation that inherently involve reduction, selection, and standardization that might leave out crucial information by accident, or on purpose. There is no better example for this than Jorge Luis Borges' one-paragraph story []"On Exactitude in Science"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Exactitude_in_Science): 

> …In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a
single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.
—Suarez Miranda,Viajes de varones prudentes, Libro IV,Cap. XLV, Lerida, 1658

This understanding, that a map is an abstraction of reality, relying on preset conventions that vary depending on what story the map should tell, when this story was told and at whom it was addressed, is fundamental to approaching maps in historical research.

There are multiple ways for historians to use maps for historical research. They can serve as primary sources which offer information on spaces at the time they were produced or for insights into how different societies perceived and represented space at different times. However, historians also use maps as analytical tools to convey knowledge or as powerful visualization tools to communicate historical findings and narratives. For this, oftentimes, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which allow for layering of information in the form of data – from demographic information to locations of buildings – and tracking spatial changes over time are used. 

The technological tools we have at our disposal today, have transformed how historians access and utilize cartographic resources. In this lesson we will differentiate between two types of maps: (1) maps which were produced in the analogue age but are now accessible as a digital representation online; and (2) maps which were “born digital”. 

## 1 Acceding to maps in the digital age: the mediation of the online repository  

*Learning outcome 1 -critically analyze a digital repository to evaluate the provenance of a map* 
*Learning outcome 2 -recognize the variety of digital repositories providing access to maps* 

In the digital age, it is far easier to access maps, than it was before. With the onset of large-scale digitization efforts at libraries and archives, maps have also become far more accessible due to their availability online. Digital libraries and repositories provide manifold cartographic sources. However, the number of openly accessible maps, the quality of digitisation, the technical features linked to the maps as well as additional information provided to each map are highly disparate, **reflecting different purpose or conditions of creation of the archive**, means of funding, **or community investment**.  

### 1a Interrogating the (digital) map archive
Each online library has its advantages and disadvantages, **but this is highly dependent on the intended use of the resources one wishes to make** and the research question(s). For some projects, a simple map giving an overview over a certain region may be already sufficient; other projects may necessitate very large scale maps including detailed information about the date of production, the publisher, etc. **In any case, the information provided by a map repository should allow historians to establish with certitude the provenance and the origin of the available resources.** 

The following list proposes a selection of online map libraries that can be interesting for historians. There are many more, but we can start exploring here:

[OldMapsOnline](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/){:target="_blank"}

[David Rumsey Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/){:target="_blank"}

[Virtuelles Kartenforum](https://kartenforum.slub-dresden.de/){:target="_blank"}

[Arcanum Maps - The Historical Map Portal](https://maps.arcanum.com/en/){:target="_blank"}

[Virtual Map Collection](http://chartae-antiquae.cz/en/){:target="_blank"}

[Mapster](http://igrek.amzp.pl/){:target="_blank"}

**Please follow the links provided above and compare the different repositories (if your time is limited, pick no less than three to make the comparison). Look for the following information: 
1. Who is the creator of the website
2. Which is the purpose of the website
3. What kind of maps the website provides: explore the geographical/thematical scope and language(s) available
4. How are the maps displayed? You may find static images, in short photos of digitized maps, or interactive maps, which means they are based on layers of information, that we call Geographical Information Systems (see assignment number ... )
5. Are the maps reusable: downloadable and possible to reuse (republish, remix...) without copyright restrictions? What is the kind of permission the users have if nay?  

### 1b The collaborative map archive 

At least two of these websites, [OldMapsOnline](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Virtuelles Kartenforum](https://kartenforum.slub-dresden.de/){:target="_blank"} involve participatory practices based on a [community of contributors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice). 

Please explore them and note: 
1. What is the purpose of involving community users? What are they asked to do? 
2. How can a user be actively involved? What are the actions one needs to take in order to be able to contribute? Note how they can access the resources and contribute as identified user
3. Are there specific instructions one has to follow (guidelines)? 
4. How are the contributions controlled and validated? 
5. How are the contributions credited? 

### 1c 
Compare topographic maps which you can find on [Kartenforum](https://kartenforum.slub-dresden.de/){:target="_blank"} and on [Arcanum](https://maps.arcanum.com/en/){:target="_blank"}. What kind of additional information are on the map, such as date of publication, cartographer or editor? What are the advantages and disadvantages of these two online libraries?



Assignment A-1: Do the notices provide sufficient information (metadata quality) for contextualizing the maps and evaluating them as source?
Compare topographic maps which you can find on Kartenforum (https://kartenforum.slub-dresden.de/) and on Arcanum (https://maps.arcanum.com/en/). What kind of additional information can you find about the map (e.g. date of publication, cartographer or editor)? Is there information that you would need that is missing? Why might that be? What are advantages and disadvantages of these two online libraries concerning accessibility (Can you access the maps easily? Are they downloadable so you can do your own analysis with them?), user interface (Can you navigate the website with ease?), topics available (What research might be done with the maps provided?), etc.?
