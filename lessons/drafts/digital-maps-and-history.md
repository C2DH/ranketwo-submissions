## Introduction 

Maps are sources for manifold projects in historiography. Browsing the internet, we find a wide variety of maps in online-libraries and repositories. Therefore, this lesson is about how to use digitally available maps in historical research. In the lesson, we will deal with two kind of maps: (1) maps which were produced in the analogue age but are now accessible as a digital representation online; and (2) maps which were created digitally. We explore how to deal with these maps, i.e. how to analyse and to contextualise them.

Nowadays, we are familiar with web map services on our smart phones, such as GoogleMaps or OpenStreetMap. They provide ‘exact’ information about locations, distances and topographic features. In many regards, we perceive these web map services as ‘correct’ or ‘realiable’, because these services ‘work’. They do what we expect of them: They guide us to a particular place. However, at the same time, no map is neutral. Maps are much more than just instruments for conveying knowledge, development and orientation. If we understand maps as representations of space, in which objects, facts or processes are two-dimensional, reduced in size and are recorded using standardized methods and drawing systems, it quickly becomes clear why maps can by no means be authentic portraits of the space they represent. All maps are questionable systems of statements.

In historical research, maps can be useful in many regards: a topographic map may give us the location of historic settlements, a map about the results of elections shows the spatial distribution of votes, or a map about oil resources may have guided exploitation. At the same time, it is the historian's task to critically examine the “message” of the map: Why does the map highlight some features, while it neglects others? What could have been the intention of the map maker for applying a particular colour?

## Assignment 1 - Access to Maps

In the digital age, it is far easier to access maps, than it was before. Digital libraries and repositories provide manifold cartographic sources. However, differences between libraries are huge regarding the amount of available maps, the quality of digitisation, the technical features to access maps as well as the additional information provided for each map.

Each online library has its advantages and disadvantages. It depends upon the project what kind of online library provides the best maps to a specific research question. For some projects, a simple map giving an overview over a certain region may be already sufficient. For other projects, we may need very large scale maps including information about the date of production, the publisher, etc.

The following list shows a small number of interesting online map libraries. There are many more, but we can start exploring here:

[OldMapsOnline](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/)

[David Rumsey Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/)

[Virtuelles Kartenforum](https://kartenforum.slub-dresden.de/)

[Arcanum Maps - The Historical Map Portal](https://maps.arcanum.com/en/)

[Virtual Map Collection](http://chartae-antiquae.cz/en/)

[Mapster](http://igrek.amzp.pl/)



Assignment A-1:
Compare topographic maps which you can find on [Kartenforum](https://kartenforum.slub-dresden.de/) and on [Arcanum](https://maps.arcanum.com/en/). What kind of additional information are on the map, such as date of publication, cartographer or editor? What are the advantages and disadvantages of these two online libraries?



## Assignment 2 - Methods to Analyse Maps 

In research literature, there is a wide variety of methodological reflections concerning map analysis, usually called “critical cartography”. A suitable approach to maps largely depends upon the specific type of cartographic material which is about to be examined and upon the research question. Despite the variety of analytical tools, many authors advocate comparative approaches. 

We may start with rather basic questions, such as: why does a certain map show a feature in a particular way, and why is this feature shown differently on another map? Step by step, we go more into details of the map. For some differences, we may easily find possible explanations. Let us take a simple example from two school atlases: A standard world map in a German school-atlas shows Europe at its centre (euro-centric), whereas in a Japanese school-atlas, the world map places East Asia at its centre. A likely explanation refers to the countries, where these school atlases were produced: Each publisher wants to have his “own” country centred. 

Going more into details of maps, the tackling of such comparative questions may turn out rather difficult, such as: Why did these two world maps use different colours, why did the cartographers choose different map projections? For many maps, we will not find detailed background material which gives insight into the production process and into the cartographer’s decisions. Therefore, we should proceed carefully when starting our interpretation and elaborating explanations regarding the appearance and content of maps.

Illustration B-1: German School-Atlas, World Map
Illustration B-2: Japanese School-Atlas, World Map

In order to analyse maps, we set out using the general guidelines of dealing with historical sources. We may start with the basic questions: Who produced the map? When was is created? What is the content of the map? How is the map content presented? Why was the map created? To whom was the map addressed? After these basic questions, we should go deeper into details, analysing the particular purpose which the map should fulfil, and examining possible intentions of the map creators.

Analysing a map, we should keep in mind, that the authors, cartographers and editors of maps have to make many decisions in the course of map production: They have to select particular features from the plenty of spatial information available: Which spatial features, objects or information should actually be represented in the map? To do this, map authors and map editors focus on a few features that should be visualized. Specific cartographic ‘languages’ and styles (symbols, colours etc.) for this have developed over centuries. Since the 19th century, increasing international exchange among cartographers and editors led to various implicit or explicit conventions regarding map design, such as putting geographic North to the top of the map. 

The production of maps is therefore based on a chain of decisions and therefore filters spatial reality. Most likely, the cartographer has applied particular techniques to support a specific perception of his/her map and counter unwanted interpretations. As a result, maps are media for categorizing, systematizing, levelling and stereotyping spatial features and individual characteristics of the objects depicted on them. They are based on the visual equation of different manifestations of the same phenomenon, arbitrarily set as a standard or group of characteristics. The choice of the area of space that can be seen on a map and the allocation of centres and peripheral locations are already connected.

## Critical Approaches to Maps 

### Topic 1: Representing Imperial Power
(Christian Lotz)
Maps can be an impressive tool to visualize power. Since early modern times, cartographers in kingdoms, nation states as well as empires have used the map to mark borders, to outline territorial ambitions or to demonstrate influence over far reaching lands. In order to analyse the power of these maps, we should examine obvious techniques to highlight power and influence, as well as less obvious techniques. The following example takes up two maps of the world which show the influence of the British Empire during the 1920s and 1930s.

![Chambers of Commerce Atlas, General Reference Map, 1928](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/chambers-of-commerce-1928-world-map.jpg "Chambers of Commerce Atlas, General Reference Map, 1928")

Illustration 1.1.: Chambers of Commerce Atlas, General Reference Map, 1928

The map is part of the „Chambers of Commerce Atlas“, published in London in 1928. The Chambers are one of the main British institution to facilitate world-wide trade. The Atlas was directed to British and other English speaking readers interested in trade routes as well as the spatial distribution of natural resources and commercial capacities. The “General Reference Map” uses red colour to indicate territories which belong to the British Empire. Besides this obvious (and colourful) technique to highlight British influence over the world, there are a few less obvious techniques, such as the use of place names: For example, the map uses the names Bombay (in India) and Constantinopole (in Turkey), and not Mumbaī and İstanbul, because  Bombay and Constantinopole were the names commonly in use in English language for these two cities. For British readers, these place names gave suitable orientation. At the same time, the use of these place names suggests a world which is British, or at least: a world that is an English speaking world. While English was (and is) of course a main language for global trade, these place names neglect the presence of other cultures and languages, which could have been represented in place names like Mumbaī, İstanbul and others.

![Radó, “International Movements of Capital”, 1938](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/international-movements-of-capital-1938.jpg "International Movements of Capital, 1938")


Illustration 1.2.: Radó, “International Movements of Capital”, 1938

The map “International Movements of Capital” belongs to the „Atlas of today and tomorrow“ published by Alexander (Sándor) Radó, also in London, in 1938. The atlas outlines the cleavages of global conflicts in the early 20th century. Most of the maps in the atlas were designed in black and white, some maps additionally include red colour. On the map, circles and arrows demonstrate the amount of capital flowing from major powers to other parts of the world. The visual strength of the map derives from the arrows and lines linking different parts of the world. Various interpretations are possible: Do the lines and arrows demonstrate the competition between the British Empire and the rising power of the United States of America? Or does the map allow for a visual comparison of investment strategies: the British capital is invested overseas, while, for example, French capital mainly goes to Central and Eastern European countries? Or do these lines symbolize dangerous octopuses, reaching out to grab more and more parts of the world?

### Topic 2: History Takes Place. Maps and Aerial Photography

(Tabitha Redepenning)

Mapping an area is a means of accessing, naming, and, in a sense, ruling it. This proves particularly important in warfare. Precise maps were needed to identify weak points and crucial targets. On maps for public use, fortifications and military information often remained invisible, only outlined in vague shapes or blank spaces. One could argue due to the cruciality of this information, maps published by administrative authorities are the most precise ones. Nevertheless, the existence of precise maps posed the danger of them falling into enemies’ hands. So, even with topographic maps by administrative authorities, a critical analysis is needed to understand the content of the map. With World War II, a new and powerful tool for surveying became popular: aerial photography. Military technology enabled new ways of scouting the surface of the earth for vital infrastructure. Moreover, it was used to evaluate damage caused by air raids. 

During World War II, all major belligerent powers pursued aerial reconnaissance, including Germany, Great Britain, the United States of America, and the Soviet Union. An important collection of aerial photography is the National Collection of Arial Photography (NCAP), which is digitalising thousands of (British and foreign) photographs and make them available on [their website](https://ncap.org.uk/). 

Each series of photographs allows us even to track the route of one specific plane during its flight. 

![Detail of Topographic Map of Stettin, 1945](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/1945-stettin-soviet-1-50000-crop.jpg "Detail of Topographic Map of Stettin, 1945")

Illustration 2.1: Detail of Topographic Map of Stettin, 1945 

The first illustration is a detail of a topographic map of Stettin in a scale of 1:50.000, created in 1945. Until the end of World War II, Stettin was a German town. For allied forces, it was a main target due to its harbour, access to the Baltic Sea, and several industries. During the war, bomb raids on Szczecin were done mainly by the UK and US. In the end, Soviet forces conquered the city. After 1945, it was handed over to Polish authorities and remains, up until this day, a town right next to Poland’s border with Germany. In 1945, a Soviet cartographer created this topographic map. The description translates: “This map was produced in 1945 after a 1:25 000 German field-work from 1888, edited in 1911, 28, 29 and 1936”. This explains the first curiosity. The labelling is a Cyrillic transliteration of the German terms for the city: “ОБЕРВИК” is “Oberwiek”, the Southern part of the town with several industrial sites. It is mixed with Russian expressions, such as “больн” ( the abbreviation for “hospital”). What errors might have occurred when considering the specific conditions of  map production? What is the estimated reliability of this topographic map as a representation of the city in 1945?

![Royal Air Force, Aerial Photograph, 28th November 1943](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/1943-11-28_NCAP-3070_TR_crop.png "Royal Air Force, Aerial Photograph, 28th November 1943") 
Illustration 2.2: Royal Air Force, Aerial Photograph, 28th November 1943. 

URL: https://ncap.org.uk/frame/6-1-5-3-254?pos=9 [13.03.2024]

The NCAP provides the following information about the image in the file’s metadata: “Location: Pommerensdorf; West Pomeranian Province; Poland; 28th November 1943; Corporate bodies: 540 Squadron (RAF)”. Interestingly, it shows the city's current nationality (“Poland”), instead of the nationality during World War II (i.e. Germany). In addition, it does not regard the municipal incorporation of “Pommerensdorf [sic!]” into Stettin in 1939. Those research hurdles are the results of the city’s troubled history. 

Analysing the picture and comparing it to the topographic map, the same train rails, the flow of the river Oder/Odra and the islands are recognisable. What objects are only visible in the photograph? While the train tracks are shown, the map does not mark the goods station’s wagon depot. The hospital buildings can be identified south of the wagon depot and the small park. However, the municipal gasworks across the tracks to the hospital’s East (recognisable by their round building structure) remain hidden on the map. Only information from other maps or the knowledge of the building shapes make the identification possible. This specific part of the town was heavily damaged by bomb raids already in April 1943. Therefore, empty fields, buildings without roofs and even some bomb craters are visible in the photograph. 

Assignment 2.1.: Track the flights over Stettin/Szczecin on the NCAP archive by using the interactive map. How many were there, and when were they conducted? 

https://ncap.org.uk/search?pos=9%20%5B13.03.2024%5D&archive=6-1-5-3 
Read the Wikipedia articles on the squadrons (e.g. 540 Squadron [RAF]) of the flights as help. What are possible explanations for the route, the timing, and which city areas were left out? 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._540_Squadron_RAF


Assignment 2.2. What advantage does the topographic map have compared to an aerial photograph? Consider the circumstances of aerial photography from this period. Comparing different photographs will give insight. 


### Topic 3: Imagining Populations in Maps - authored by Peter Haslinger

Since the 19th century, the ideas of nationalism increased the importance of population, of ethnicity, language and religion in political debates as well as in cartographic production. The censuses conducted on a regular basis provided a statistical basis for assessing the changes when it came to preferred language use or demographic development over a longer period. This created political anxieties. In Europe and in other parts of the world, politicians and cartographers in neighbouring countries debated about the existence and non-existence of majorities or minorities of population on both sides of the borders.

The following two examples give insight into aspects of these cartographic debates about population by the end of World War One. Both maps date from the First World War or the immediate post-war period. With regard to the future political landscape after the war, both take a position of legitimizing a national-territorial claim. Both map authors (Eugeniusz Romer, and Pál Teleki, 1879-1941) were founding fathers of geography in their respective countries. The maps created by them were used by the delegations during the peace conference in Paris 1919/20 and were also published.

Eugeniusz Romer (1871-1954) had produced maps during the First World War, which now served as cartographic templates for the Polish delegation maps at the Paris peace conference (published as Polski atlas kongresowy in 1921). His high credibility among international geographers and his personal friendships with some experts on the side of the Allied Powers, especially the highly influential American expert Isiah Bowman, increased the authoritativeness of the maps presented by the Polish delegation among the decision makers. In a map entitled “The political and ethnographical territory of Poland (1772)”, Romer supports a maximalistic approach to Polish territorial claims by the combination of the territory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (“Poland” in it’s borders of 1772) and additional areas in the west with some Polish populations. We can see the strategy of creating a normative connection between language use and political boundaries.

![“Population - Romer 1916 Atlas Polski - Nr-9-Polacy 1922 A188”](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/population-romer-1916-atlas-polski-nr-9-Polacy-1922-A188.jpg "Romer 1916 Atlas Polski")


Pál Teleki (1879-1941), future Prime Minister on two occasions, became the leading geographer and academic mastermind of Hungarian cartography and geopolitics. Teleki’s extensive language skills had helped establish his international reputation before the war (he spoke German, French, and English, as well as some Dutch, Italian, and Romanian). During the peace negotiations between Hungary and the Allied Powers at Trianon, the official Hungarian delegation promoted the idea that Hungary was one of the most striking morphological units on the physical map of Europe, with a practically uninhabited belt of the Carpathians surrounding most of the country and creating a natural barrier. As a preparation for the peace talks he drafted the famous “carte rouge” as early as December 1918. This map was now used as an attachment to the Hungarian memoranda in order to retain as much territory as possible for Hungary and was published in several editions even after the peace treaty of Trianon had been signed on June 4, 1920. Teleki’s method of not including areas that were less populated, and his choice of colors (light red for Hungarian, faint pink for Romanian) overemphasized the Hungarian-speaking minority population in Transylvania at the expense of the Romanian-speaking majority.

Assignment 3.1.
Compare both maps and answer the following questions:

* What exactly is shown on the maps? 
* What national perspectives are presented here?

Assignment 3.2.
* What kind of borders do you see? 
* What do the differently coloured territories stand for? 
* What is the statistical basis for this map? 
* What does the colour red stand for and what visual effect is it supposed to achieve? 
* How should the white areas on the map be interpreted?

Assignment 3.3.
* What does the map tell us about the political intention of the map author through the choice of map section and the drawn boundaries?

### Topic 4: Reporting War 1914 and 2024 - authored by Christian Lotz

Times of war are times of massive map production. While military maps are kept secret during the war, because they depict points of strategic interest, there is a huge number of maps produced for public use. These kind of public maps are published to show the development of war, the advancement of troops or the loss of territory. Public maps about warfare are a highly sensitive source for historiography, because wars are fought not only with weapons, but also with images. Therefore, we should guide a special focus on questions like who provided information and data to be shown on the map, and what was the particular purpose of the production of such public maps.

In this part of the lesson, we compare maps from the First World War 1914-1918 and maps of the Russian-Ukrainian War since 2022. During the First World War, public maps about the war were mainly published in newspapers and journals. Most of these maps had a relatively small scale, i.e. the map showed a rough sketch of the front line between two countries in a scale of 1:1 Million to 1:5 Million. In case a part of the front line was of particular interest, some publishers added medium scale maps, for example about Verdun and its surroundings on the Franco-German front.

Illustration 4-1: Verein für Kriegshilfe: Map of the Western front as of February 1915

![Verein für Kriegshilfe: Map of the Western front as of February 1915](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/Reporting-War_1915_Kriegshilfe-Muenchen_Voelkerkrieg_01.jpg "Verein für Kriegshilfe: Map of the Western front as of February 1915") 

This kind of small scale public maps were issued weekly. The regular rhythm of publication made these maps an important medium of information and propaganda: It showed the progress or non-progress of front lines, it informed readers at least roughly about areas in danger to be directly affected by the war, and it demonstrated gain and loss of territory. However, these small scale maps did not let the reader get closer to the situation along the front line. The armies kept large scale maps secret which showed trenches and fortified places, because publicly known details would allow the enemy to more precisely direct its attacks.

Illustration 4-2: Large scale map, Franco-German front, February 1915 **The image file is missing, should ask the authors**. 

A couple of decades after a war is over, archives in many countries give access to these kind of large scale maps. Usually, such maps were printed by the army map services. Surveying officers at the front line used hand drawn remarks to keep them up to date in order to provide a reliable image of the situation. The question „what is the content of the map“ may lead us to a variety of answers: Of course, the topography of the hills and valleys South of Verdun as well as the tight network of trenches are visible on the map. In addition, we can take the map as a representation of static warfare (armies on both sides fight over just a few hundred meters to capture the opposite trench) and as a representation of a huge grave yard with thousands of soldiers who died in these fields.
Today, we also find many small scale maps about ongoing wars in the world printed in newspapers and journals, for example about the Russian-Ukrainian war since 2022. In addition to newspaper maps, there are many more maps online, small scale and large scale. These digital maps are either static images or web map services that provide specific data and that change of the course of time.


Illustration 4-3: files “Reporting-War_2023_LiveUkraineMap_01” and “LiveUAmap_2023-06-07_Ukraine”, a Screenshot of Ukraine on LiveUAmap on the 23th of June 2023

The example of the LiveUAmap is a multi-scale map. In a small scale it allows for an overview, in large scale the user can zoom in to the front line in a particular region. The content of the map derives from various sources, such as the Telegramm messager service. The LiveUAmap is provided by a Non Governmental Organisation based in McLean (Virginia, USA). Although we can zoom in to a large scale map, and although we can find information about the front line in detail, the map does not provide data about the positions of fortified places or military installations on the Ukrainian side.

### Topic 5: Datasets as Maps? Evaluating GIS-data about historical phenomena

(Christian Lotz)

Since the late 20th century, the computer has become a major tool for creating maps. For about three decades, more and more maps have been produced digitally. For historians, two major aspects are interesting with regard to digital maps: First, what kind of digital map tools can be useful to pursue research questions; and second, how can we investigate the particular mixture of digital and man-made factors that influence the production and distribution of maps. As this lessons deals with questions of source criticism, we will not tackle the first question, but will focus on the second one.

Generally speaking, there are two ways of digital map production. Either the cartographer uses Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The main feature of GIS software is the capability of dealing with geographical data such as coordinates. A widely known open source software is [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/). Or various kinds of non-GIS software can be adopted to create maps, in particular software which enables the cartographer to draw and design visual images, such as [LibreOfficeDraw](https://www.libreoffice.org). In practice, many cartographers combine these two types of software to create maps, for example using GIS software to arrange geographical data, and then improving the design of the map using non-GIS software.

This lesson will not (and can not) give an introduction into software used to create maps. Those kind of introductions are already available online (https://opensourceoptions.com/qgis-tutorial-for-beginners/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg4_duqH5Q4). Instead, this part of the lesson seeks to demonstrate, how historians can critically evaluate available GIS data and the maps which were created based on these data.

As mentioned in the introduction, various repositories provide GIS data and digital maps, such as [Harvard-GIS](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/harvard-geospatial-library). Historians (and other users) can download geo-packages from these repositories and open them in QGIS, in order to analyse the content. Regarding digital source criticism, we should focus our analysis on the following questions: What is the origin of the data, which were used to create the data set in QGIS? To what extend did the creators of the data set transform the original information, in order to get these information into the QGIS data set? What kind of categories did the creators of the data set choose, in order to bring these information into the data set?

As an example, we can investigate a data set of the „Imperiia Project“ run by Kelly O’Neill at Harvard University. The Imperiia Project created data sets about the administrative borders of the Russian Empire.


Illustration 5.1 shows the data set about the Kingdom of Poland as part of the Russian Empire at the beginning of the 19th century. The authors of the data set describe the preparation of data and the sources from which they extracted the information about borders. For each administrative entity a name in Russian (Cyrillic) and in a latin transliteration is given.

![Kingdom of Poland as part of the Russian Empire in the 19th c., visualization of a dataset obtained in QGIS](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/Abb-5-1_QGIS_Imperiia-Project_02.jpg "Visualization of a historical dataset, Imperiia project, in QGIS - the Kingdom of Poland as part of the Russian Empire in the 19th c.")

Illustration 5.2, shows a data set about the border of the partitions of Poland. The data set was created by Christopher Winters at Chicago University. Comparing Abb-5-1 and Abb-5-2, the amount of additional information to the data set is very different. While the Imperiia Project provides sources for the data set, there are no sources given in Winters‘ data set. The absence of sources does not mean that the data set is wrong or that the depicted line of border is not correct. However, from a historian‘s perspective, it is far more difficult to deal with material that does not provide any information about its origin.

![Polish historical boundaries, visualization of a dataset obtained in QGIS](/assets/images/maps-as-historical-sources/Abb-5-2_QGIS_Winter-Poland-borders_UChicago_01.jpg "Visualization of Polish historical boundaries based on datasets of historian Christopher Winters, obtained in QGIS - the Kingdom of Poland as part of the Russian Empire in the 19th c.")

### Final Message

Best things in live are analogue! Many university libraries still have (paper) map collections. Leave your computer, enter your library and ask for these collections! You may be astonished to see maps that are much bigger than the screen of your computer!
